## Introduction

**Filament is a Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework for Laravel.** It allows you to define user interfaces entirely in PHP using structured configuration objects, rather than traditional templating. Built on top of Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS, Filament empowers you to build full-featured interfaces like admin panels, dashboards, and form-based apps, all without writing custom JavaScript or frontend code.

<Disclosure>
    <span slot="summary">What is Server-Driven UI?</span>

    SDUI is a proven architecture used by companies like Meta, Airbnb, and Shopify. It moves control of the UI to the server, allowing for faster iteration, greater consistency, and centralized logic. Filament embraces this pattern for web development, letting you define interfaces declaratively using PHP classes that are rendered into HTML by the server.
    
    One key distinction to note is the difference between Server-Driven UI (SDUI) and Server-Rendered UI. While both approaches involve rendering content on the server, Server-Rendered UI relies on static templates (like traditional Blade views), where the structure and behavior of the UI are defined upfront in HTML or PHP files. In contrast, SDUI gives the server the power to dynamically generate the UI based on real-time configurations and business logic, allowing for more flexibility and reactivity without needing to modify frontend templates directly.
</Disclosure>

Thousands of developers use Filament to add admin panels to their Laravel applications, but it goes far beyond that. You can use Filament to build custom dashboards, user portals, CRMs, or even full applications with multiple panels. It integrates seamlessly with any frontend stack and works especially well alongside tools like Inertia.js, Livewire, and Blade.

If you're already using Blade views in your Laravel app, Filament components can enhance them too. You can drop Livewire components powered by Filament into any Blade view or route, and use the same schema-based builders for forms, tables, and more, all without switching your entire stack.

## Packages

The core of Filament comprises several packages:

- `filament/filament` - The core package for building panels (e.g., admin panels). This requires all other packages since panels often use many of their features.
- `filament/tables` - A data table builder that allows you to render an interactive table with filtering, sorting, pagination, and more.
- `filament/schemas` - A package that allows you to build UIs using an array of "component" PHP objects as configuration. This is used by many features in Filament to render UI. The package includes a base set of components that allow you to render content.
- `filament/forms` - A set of `filament/schemas` components for a large variety of form inputs (fields), complete with integrated validation.
- `filament/infolists` - A set of `filament/schemas` components for rendering "description lists". An infolist consists of "entries", which are key-value UI elements that can present read-only information like text, icons, and images. The data for an infolist can be sourced from anywhere but commonly comes from an individual Eloquent record.
- `filament/actions` - Action objects encapsulate the UI for a button, an interactive modal window that can be opened by the button, and the logic that should be executed when the modal window is submitted. They can be used anywhere in the UI and are commonly used to perform one-time actions like deleting a record, sending an email, or updating data in the database based on modal form input.
- `filament/notifications` - An easy way to send notifications to users in your app's UI. You can send a "flash" notification that appears immediately after a request to the server, a "database" notification which is stored in the database and rendered in a slide-over modal the user can open on demand, or a "broadcast" notification that is sent to the user in real-time over a websocket connection.
- `filament/widgets` - A set of dashboard "widgets" that can render anything, often statistical data. Charts, numbers, tables, and completely custom widgets can be rendered in a dashboard using this package.
- `filament/support` - This package contains a set of shared UI components and utilities used by all other packages. Users don't commonly install this directly, as it is a dependency of all other packages.

## Plugins

Filament is designed to be highly extensible, allowing you to add your own UI components and features to the framework. These extensions can live inside your codebase if they're specific to your application, or be distributed as Composer packages if they're general-purpose. In the Filament ecosystem, these Composer packages are called "plugins", and hundreds are available from the community. The Filament team also officially maintains several plugins that provide integration with popular third-party packages in the Laravel ecosystem.

The vast majority of plugins in the ecosystem are open-source and free to use. Some premium plugins are available for purchase, often offering enhanced customer support and quality.

<Aside variant="warning">
    Plugins not maintained by Filament team are created and managed by independent authors. While these plugins can enhance your experience, Filament cannot guarantee their quality, security, compatibility, or maintenance. We recommend reviewing the plugin's code, documentation, and user feedback before installation.
</Aside>

You can browse an extensive list of official and community plugins on the [Filament website](/plugins).

## Customizing the appearance

Tailwind CSS is a utility-based CSS framework that Filament uses as a token-based design system. Although Filament does not use Tailwind CSS utility classes directly in the HTML rendered by its components, it compiles Tailwind utilities into semantic CSS. These semantic classes can be targeted by Filament users with their own CSS to modify the appearance of components, creating a thin layer of overrides on top of the default Filament design.

A simple example demonstrating the power of this system is changing the border radius of all button components in Filament. By default, the following CSS code is used in the Filament codebase to style buttons using Tailwind utility classes:

```css
.fi-btn {
    @apply rounded-lg px-3 py-2 text-sm font-medium outline-none;
}
```

To decrease the [border radius in Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/border-radius), you can apply the `rounded-sm` (small) utility class to `.fi-btn` in your own CSS file:

```css
.fi-btn {
    @apply rounded-sm;
}
```

This overrides the default `rounded-lg` class with `rounded-sm` for all buttons in Filament while preserving the other styling properties of the button. This system provides a high level of flexibility to customize the appearance of Filament components without needing to write a complete custom stylesheet or maintain copies of HTML for each component.

For more information about customizing the appearance of Filament, visit the [Customizing styling documentation](../styling).

## Testing

The core packages in Filament undergo unit testing to ensure stability across releases. As a Filament user, you can write tests for applications built with the framework. Filament provides utilities for testing both functionality and UI components, compatible with either Pest or PHPUnit test suites. Testing is particularly crucial when customizing the framework or implementing custom functionality, though it's also valuable for verifying basic functionality works as intended.

For more information about testing Filament applications, visit the [Testing documentation](../testing).

## Alternatives to Filament

If you're reading this and concluding that Filament might not be the right choice for your project, that's okay! There are many other excellent projects in the Laravel ecosystem that might be a better fit for your needs. Here are a few we really like:

### Filament sounds too complicated

[Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) is an easy way to build an admin panel for your Laravel application. It's an official project maintained by the Laravel team, and purchasing it helps support the development of the Laravel framework.

### I do not want to use Livewire to customize anything

Many parts of Filament do not require you to touch Livewire at all, but building custom components might.

[Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) is built with Vue.js and Inertia.js, which might be a better fit for your project if it requires extensive customization and you have experience with these tools.

### I need an out-of-the-box CMS

[Statamic](https://statamic.com) is a CMS built on Laravel. It's a great choice if you need a CMS that's easy to set up and use, and you don't need to build a custom admin panel.

### I just want to write Blade views and handle the backend myself

[Flux](https://fluxui.dev) is the official Livewire UI kit and ships as a set of pre-built and pre-styled Blade components. It is maintained by the same team that maintains Livewire and Alpine.js, and purchasing it helps support the development of these projects.

---

---
title: Installation
contents: false
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"
import RadioGroup from "@components/RadioGroup.astro"
import RadioGroupOption from "@components/RadioGroupOption.astro"

Filament requires the following to run:

- PHP 8.2+
- Laravel v11.28+
- Tailwind CSS v4.0+

Installation comes in two flavors, depending on whether you want to build an app using our panel builder or use the components within your app's Blade views:

<div x-data="{ package: (window.location.hash === '#components') ? 'components' : 'panels' }">

<RadioGroup model="package">
    <RadioGroupOption value="panels">
        Panel builder

        <span slot="description">
            Most people choose this option to build a panel (e.g., admin panel) for their app. The panel builder combines all the individual components into a cohesive framework. You can create as many panels as you like within a Laravel installation, but you only need to install it once.
        </span>
    </RadioGroupOption>

    <RadioGroupOption value="components">
        Individual components

        <span slot="description">
            If you are using Blade to build your app from scratch, you can install individual components from Filament to enrich your UI.
        </span>
    </RadioGroupOption>
</RadioGroup>

<div x-show="package === 'panels'" x-cloak>

## Installing the panel builder

Install the Filament Panel Builder by running the following commands in your Laravel project directory:

```bash
composer require filament/filament:"^4.0"

php artisan filament:install --panels
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    When using Windows PowerShell to install Filament, you may need to run the command below, since it ignores `^` characters in version constraints:

    ```bash
    composer require filament/filament:"~4.0"

    php artisan filament:install --panels
    ```
</Aside>

This will create and register a new [Laravel service provider](https://laravel.com/docs/providers) called `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php`.

<Aside variant="tip">
    If you get an error when accessing your panel, check that the service provider is registered in `bootstrap/providers.php`. If it's not registered, you'll need to [add it manually](https://laravel.com/docs/providers#registering-providers).
</Aside>

You can create a new user account using the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-user
```

Open `/admin` in your web browser, sign in, and [start building your app](../getting-started)!

</div>

<div
    x-show="package === 'components'" 
    x-data="{ laravelProject: 'new' }"
    x-cloak
>

## Installing the individual components

Install the Filament components you want to use with Composer:

```bash
composer require
    filament/tables:"^4.0"
    filament/schemas:"^4.0"
    filament/forms:"^4.0"
    filament/infolists:"^4.0"
    filament/actions:"^4.0"
    filament/notifications:"^4.0"
    filament/widgets:"^4.0"
```

You can install additional packages later in your project without having to repeat these installation steps.

<Aside variant="warning">
    When using Windows PowerShell to install Filament, you may need to run the command below, since it ignores `^` characters in version constraints:

    ```bash
    composer require
        filament/tables:"~4.0"
        filament/schemas:"~4.0"
        filament/forms:"~4.0"
        filament/infolists:"~4.0"
        filament/actions:"~4.0"
        filament/notifications:"~4.0"
        filament/widgets:"~4.0"
    ```
</Aside>

If you only want to use the set of [Blade UI components](../components), you'll need to require `filament/support` at this stage.

<RadioGroup model="laravelProject">
    <RadioGroupOption value="new">
        New Laravel projects

        <span slot="description">
            Get started with Filament components quickly by running a simple command. Note that this will overwrite any modified files in your app, so it's only suitable for new Laravel projects.
        </span>
    </RadioGroupOption>

    <RadioGroupOption value="existing">
        Existing Laravel projects

        <span slot="description">
            If you have an existing Laravel project, you can still install Filament, but should do so manually to preserve your existing functionality.
        </span>
    </RadioGroupOption>
</RadioGroup>

<div x-show="laravelProject === 'new'" x-cloak>

To quickly set up Filament in a new Laravel project, run the following commands to install [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com):

<Aside variant="warning">
    These commands will overwrite existing files in your application. Only run them in a new Laravel project!
</Aside>

Run the following command to install the Filament frontend assets:

```bash
php artisan filament:install --scaffold

npm install

npm run dev
```

During scaffolding, if you have the [Notifications](../notifications) package installed, Filament will ask if you want to install the required Livewire component into your default layout file. This component is required if you want to send flash notifications to users through Filament.

</div>

<div x-show="laravelProject === 'existing'" x-cloak>

Run the following command to install the Filament frontend assets:

```bash
php artisan filament:install
```

### Installing Tailwind CSS

Run the following command to install Tailwind CSS and its Vite plugin, if you don't have those installed already:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite --save-dev
```

### Configuring styles

To configure Filament's styles, you need to import the CSS files for the Filament packages you installed, usually in `resources/css/app.css`.

Depending on which combination of packages you installed, you can import only the necessary CSS files, to keep your app's CSS bundle size small:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';

/* Required by all components */
@import '../../vendor/filament/support/resources/css/index.css';

/* Required by actions and tables */
@import '../../vendor/filament/actions/resources/css/index.css';

/* Required by actions, forms and tables */
@import '../../vendor/filament/forms/resources/css/index.css';

/* Required by actions and infolists */
@import '../../vendor/filament/infolists/resources/css/index.css';

/* Required by notifications */
@import '../../vendor/filament/notifications/resources/css/index.css';

/* Required by actions, infolists, forms, schemas and tables */
@import '../../vendor/filament/schemas/resources/css/index.css';

/* Required by tables */
@import '../../vendor/filament/tables/resources/css/index.css';

/* Required by widgets */
@import '../../vendor/filament/widgets/resources/css/index.css';

@variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));
```

### Configure the Vite plugin

If it isn't already set up, add the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin to your Vite configuration (`vite.config,js`):

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'],
            refresh: true,
        }),
        tailwindcss(),
    ],
})
```

### Compiling assets

Compile your new CSS and JavaScript assets using `npm run dev`.

### Configuring your layout 

If you don't have a Blade layout file yet, create it at `resources/views/components/layouts/app.blade.php` by running the following command:

```bash
php artisan livewire:layout
```

Add the following code to your new layout file:

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <meta name="application-name" content="{{ config('app.name') }}">
        <meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

        <title>{{ config('app.name') }}</title>

        <style>
            [x-cloak] {
                display: none !important;
            }
        </style>

        @filamentStyles
        @vite('resources/css/app.css')
    </head>

    <body class="antialiased">
        {{ $slot }}

        @livewire('notifications') {{-- Only required if you wish to send flash notifications --}}

        @filamentScripts
        @vite('resources/js/app.js')
    </body>
</html>
```

The important parts of this are the `@filamentStyles` in the `<head>` of the layout, and the `@filamentScripts` at the end of the `<body>`. Make sure to also include your app's compiled CSS and JavaScript files from Vite!

<Aside variant="info">
    The `@livewire('notifications')` line is required in the layout only if you have the [Notifications](../notifications) package installed and want to send flash notifications to users through Filament.
</Aside>

</div>

</div>

</div>

title: Optimizing local development
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

This section includes optional tips to optimize performance when running your Filament app locally.

If you're looking for production-specific optimizations, check out [Deploying to production](../deployment).

## Enabling OPcache

[OPcache](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php) improves PHP performance by storing precompiled script bytecode in shared memory, thereby removing the need for PHP to load and parse scripts on each request. This can significantly speed up your local development environment, especially for larger applications.

### Checking OPcache status

To check if [OPcache](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php) is enabled, run:

```bash
php -r "echo 'opcache.enable => ' . ini_get('opcache.enable') . PHP_EOL;"
```

You should see `opcache.enable => 1`. If not, enable it by adding the following line to your `php.ini`:

```ini
opcache.enable=1 # Enable OPcache
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    To locate your `php.ini` file, run: `php --ini`
</Aside>

### Configuring OPcache settings

If you're experiencing slow response times or suspect that OPcache is running out of space, you can adjust these parameters in your `php.ini` file:

```ini
opcache.memory_consumption=128
opcache.max_accelerated_files=10000
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    To locate your `php.ini` file, run: `php --ini`
</Aside>

- `opcache.memory_consumption`: defines how much memory (in megabytes) OPcache can use to store precompiled PHP code. You can try setting this to `128` and adjust based on your project's needs.
- `opcache.max_accelerated_files`: sets the maximum number of PHP files that OPcache can cache. You can try `10000` as a starting point and increase if your application includes a large number of files.

These settings are optional but useful if you're troubleshooting performance or working on a large Laravel app.

## Exclude your project folder from antivirus scanning

Issues with the performance of Filament, particularly on Windows, often involve [Microsoft Defender](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-defender-for-individuals).

Security software, such as realtime file scanners or antivirus tools, can slow down your development environment by scanning files every time they're accessed. This can affect PHP execution, view rendering, and performance in general.

If you're noticing slowness, consider excluding your local project folder from realtime scanning.

Tools like [Microsoft Defender](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-defender-for-individuals), or similar antivirus solutions, can be configured to skip specific directories. Check your antivirus or security software documentation for instructions on how to exclude specific folders from realtime scanning.

<Aside variant="warning">
    Only exclude folders from scanning if you fully trust the project and understand the risks.
</Aside>

## Disabling debugging tools

Debugging tools can be very useful for local development, but they can significantly slow down your application when you aren't actively using them. Temporarily disabling these tools when you need maximum performance can make a noticeable difference in your development experience.

### Disabling view debugging in Laravel Herd

[Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) includes a view debugging tool for [macOS](https://herd.laravel.com/docs/macos/debugging/dumps#views) and [Windows](https://herd.laravel.com/docs/windows/debugging/dumps#views). It shows which views were rendered and what data was passed to them during a request.

While helpful for debugging, this feature can significantly slow down your app. If you're not actively using it, it's best to turn it off.

To disable view debugging in Herd:

- Open Herd > Dumps.
- Click Settings.
- Uncheck the "Views" option.

### Disabling Debugbar

While useful for debugging, [Laravel Debugbar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar) can slow down your application, especially on complex pages, because it collects and renders a large amount of data on each request.

If you're noticing slowness, try disabling it by adding the following line to your `.env` file:

```dotenv
DEBUGBAR_ENABLED=false
```

If you still need Debugbar for development, consider disabling specific collectors you're not using.
Refer to the [Debugbar documentation](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar?tab=readme-ov-file#debugbar-for-laravel) for details.

### Disabling Xdebug

[Xdebug](https://xdebug.org) is a powerful tool for debugging, but it can significantly slow down performance. If you notice performance issues, check if `Xdebug` is installed and consider disabling it.

If `Xdebug` is installed but not disabled, it will still be enabled by default. If you have it installed, make sure it is explicitly disabled in your `php.ini` file:

```ini
xdebug.mode=off # Disable Xdebug
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    To locate your `php.ini` file, run: `php --ini`
</Aside>

## Caching Blade icons

Caching [Blade icons](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons) can help improve performance during local development, especially in views that render many icons.

To enable caching, run:

```bash
php artisan icons:cache
```

Make sure that when you install new Blade icon packages, you run the command again to discover the new icons.

## New features

Pull requests for new features are only accepted for the latest major version, except in special circumstances. Once a new major version is released, the Filament team will no longer accept pull requests for new features in previous versions. Any open pull requests will either be redirected to target the latest major version or closed, depending on conflicts with the new target branch.

## Bug fixes

After a major version is released, the Filament team will continue to merge pull requests for bug fixes in the previous major version for a year. After this period, pull requests for that version will no longer be accepted.

The Filament team processes bug reports for supported versions in chronological order, though critical bugs may be prioritized. Bug fixes are typically developed only for the latest major version. However, contributors can backport fixes to other supported versions by submitting pull requests.

## Security fixes

The Filament team currently plans to continue providing security fixes for major versions for at least two years.

If you discover a security vulnerability in Filament, please [report it through GitHub](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/security/advisories). All security vulnerabilities will be addressed promptly.

Please note that while a Filament version may receive security fixes, its underlying dependencies (PHP, Laravel, and Livewire) may no longer be supported. Therefore, applications using older versions of Filament could still be vulnerable to security issues in these dependencies.

</Aside>

## Reporting bugs

If you discover a bug in Filament, please report it by opening an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/issues/new/choose). Before opening an issue, search through the [existing issues](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to check if the bug has already been reported.

Please include as much information as possible, particularly the version numbers of packages in your application. You can use this Artisan command in your application to open a new issue with all the correct versions automatically pre-filled:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-issue
```

When creating an issue, we require a "reproduction repository". **Please do not link to your actual project**. Instead, what we need is a _minimal_ reproduction in a fresh project without any unnecessary code. This means it doesn't matter if your real project is private/confidential since we want a link to a separate, isolated reproduction. This allows us to fix the problem much quicker. **Issues will be automatically closed and not reviewed if this is missing, to preserve maintainer time and ensure the process is fair for those who put effort into reporting.** If you believe a reproduction repository is not suitable for the issue, which is a very rare case, please `@danharrin` and explain why. Saying "it's just a simple issue" is not an excuse for not creating a repository! [Need a head start? We have a template Filament project for you.](https://unitedbycode.com/filament-issue)

Remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the bug report will automatically receive attention or that others will jump to fix it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem.

## Development of new features

If you would like to propose a new feature or improvement to Filament, you may use our [discussion forum](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/discussions) hosted on GitHub. If you intend to implement the feature yourself in a pull request, we advise you to `@danharrin` (a core maintainer of Filament) in your feature discussion beforehand and ask if it is suitable for the framework to prevent wasting your time.

## Development of plugins

If you would like to develop a plugin for Filament, please refer to the [plugin development section](../plugins) in the documentation. Our [Discord](https://filamentphp.com/discord) server is also a great place to ask questions and get help with plugin development. You can start a conversation in the [`#plugin-developers-chat`](https://discord.com/channels/883083792112300104/970354547723730955) channel.

You can also [submit your plugin to be advertised on the Filament website](https://github.com/filamentphp/filamentphp.com/blob/main/README.md#contributing).

## Developing with a local copy of Filament

If you want to contribute to the Filament packages, then you may want to test it in a real Laravel project:

- Fork [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament) to your GitHub account.
- Create a Laravel app locally.
- Clone your fork into your Laravel app's root directory.
- In the `/filament` directory, create a branch for your fix, e.g. `fix/error-message`.

Install the packages in your app's `composer.json`:

```jsonc
{
    // ...
    "require": {
        "filament/filament": "*",
    },
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "filament/packages/*"
        }
    ],
    // ...
}
```

Now, run `composer update`.

Once you've finished making changes, you can commit them and submit a pull request to [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament).

## Checking for outdated translations

To check for outdated translations, you can use our Translation Tool. Clone the Filament repository, install the dependencies for the commands and then run the command.

```bash
# Clone
git clone git@github.com:filamentphp/filament.git

# Install dependencies
composer install

# Run the tool  
./bin/translation-tool.php
```

First select "List outdated translations" as the command and then choose the locale you want to check. This command will show you which translations are missing for the specified locale. You can then submit a pull request with the missing translations to [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament).

## Security vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within Filament, please [report it through GitHub](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/security/advisories). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed. Please see our [version support policy](version-support-policy) to understand which versions are currently under maintenance.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that Filament is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/blob/4.x/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

Once you have [installed Filament](introduction/installation#installing-the-panel-builder), you can start building your application.

<Aside variant="info">
    This guide is for the Filament panel builder. If you are looking to use the Filament UI components outside of a panel, visit the [Components](components) documentation.
</Aside>

To start, visit `/admin` and sign in with a user account. You will be redirected to the default dashboard of the panel.

## Resources

Resources are the core of your Filament application. They are CRUD UIs for models that you want to manage in the panel.

Out of the box, Filament will generate three pages in each resource:
- **List**: A paginated table of all the records in the Eloquent model.
- **Create**: A form to create a new record.
- **Edit**: A form to edit an existing record.

You can also choose to generate a **View** page, which is a read-only display of a record.

Each resource usually has an item in the sidebar, which is automatically registered as soon as you create a resource.

To start your journey by creating a resource, visit the [Resources documentation](resources).

## Widgets

Widgets are components often used to build a dashboard, typically to display statistical data. Charts, numbers, tables, and completely custom widgets are supported.

Each widget has a PHP class and a Blade view. The PHP class is technically a [Livewire component](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/components). As such, every widget has access to the full power of Livewire to build an interactive server-rendered UI.

Out of the box, Filament's dashboard contains a couple of widgets: one which greets the user and allows them to sign out, and another which displays information about Filament.

To start your journey by adding your own widget to the dashboard, visit the [Widgets documentation](widgets).

## Custom pages

Custom pages are a blank canvas for you to build whatever you want in a panel. They are often used for settings pages, documentation, or anything else you can think of.

Each custom page has a PHP class and a Blade view. The PHP class is technically a [full-page Livewire component](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/components) (in fact, every page class in a Filament panel is a Livewire component). As such, every page has access to the full power of Livewire to build an interactive server-rendered UI.

To start your journey by creating a custom page, visit the [Custom pages documentation](navigation/custom-pages).

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

## Introduction

Resources are static classes that are used to build CRUD interfaces for your Eloquent models. They describe how administrators should be able to interact with data from your app using tables and forms.

## Creating a resource

To create a resource for the `App\Models\Customer` model:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer
```

This will create several files in the `app/Filament/Resources` directory:

```
.
+-- Customers
|   +-- CustomerResource.php
|   +-- Pages
|   |   +-- CreateCustomer.php
|   |   +-- EditCustomer.php
|   |   +-- ListCustomers.php
|   +-- Schemas
|   |   +-- CustomerForm.php
|   +-- Tables
|   |   +-- CustomersTable.php
```

Your new resource class lives in `CustomerResource.php`.

The classes in the `Pages` directory are used to customize the pages in the app that interact with your resource. They're all full-page [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) components that you can customize in any way you wish.

The classes in the `Schemas` directory are used to define the content of the [forms](../forms) and [infolists](../infolists) for your resource. The classes in the `Tables` directory are used to build the table for your resource.

<Aside variant="tip">
    Have you created a resource, but it's not appearing in the navigation menu? If you have a [model policy](#authorization), make sure you return `true` from the `viewAny()` method.
</Aside>

### Simple (modal) resources

Sometimes, your models are simple enough that you only want to manage records on one page, using modals to create, edit and delete records. To generate a simple resource with modals:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer --simple
```

Your resource will have a "Manage" page, which is a List page with modals added.

Additionally, your simple resource will have no `getRelations()` method, as [relation managers](managing-relationships) are only displayed on the Edit and View pages, which are not present in simple resources. Everything else is the same.

### Automatically generating forms and tables

If you'd like to save time, Filament can automatically generate the [form](#resource-forms) and [table](#resource-tables) for you, based on your model's database columns, using `--generate`:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer --generate
```

### Handling soft-deletes

By default, you will not be able to interact with deleted records in the app. If you'd like to add functionality to restore, force-delete and filter trashed records in your resource, use the `--soft-deletes` flag when generating the resource:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer --soft-deletes
```

You can find out more about soft-deleting [here](deleting-records#handling-soft-deletes).

### Generating a View page

By default, only List, Create and Edit pages are generated for your resource. If you'd also like a [View page](viewing-records), use the `--view` flag:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer --view
```

### Specifying a custom model namespace

By default, Filament will assume that your model exists in the `App\Models` directory. You can pass a different namespace for the model using the `--model-namespace` flag:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer --model-namespace=Custom\\Path\\Models
```

In this example, the model should exist at `Custom\Path\Models\Customer`. Please note the double backslashes `\\` in the command that are required.

Now when [generating the resource](#automatically-generating-forms-and-tables), Filament will be able to locate the model and read the database schema.

### Generating the model, migration and factory at the same name

If you'd like to save time when scaffolding your resources, Filament can also generate the model, migration and factory for the new resource at the same time using the `--model`, `--migration` and `--factory` flags in any combination:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer --model --migration --factory
```

## Record titles

A `$recordTitleAttribute` may be set for your resource, which is the name of the column on your model that can be used to identify it from others.

For example, this could be a blog post's `title` or a customer's `name`:

```php
protected static ?string $recordTitleAttribute = 'name';
```

This is required for features like [global search](global-search) to work.

<Aside variant="tip">
    You may specify the name of an [Eloquent accessor](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#defining-an-accessor) if just one column is inadequate at identifying a record.
</Aside>

## Resource forms

Resource classes contain a `form()` method that is used to build the forms on the [Create](creating-records) and [Edit](editing-records) pages.

By default, Filament creates a form schema file for you, which is referenced in the `form()` method. This is to keep your resource class clean and organized, otherwise it can get quite large:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Schemas\CustomerForm;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public static function form(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return CustomerForm::configure($schema);
}
```

In the `CustomerForm` class, you can define the fields and layout of your form:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public static function configure(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            TextInput::make('name')->required(),
            TextInput::make('email')->email()->required(),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

The `components()` method is used to define the structure of your form. It is an array of [fields](../forms#available-fields) and [layout components](../schemas/layout#available-layout-components), in the order they should appear in your form.

Check out the Forms docs for a [guide](../forms) on how to build forms with Filament.

<Aside variant="tip">
    If you would prefer to define the form directly in the resource class, you can do so and delete the form schema class altogether:

    ```php
    use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
    use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

    public static function form(Schema $schema): Schema
    {
        return $schema
            ->components([
                TextInput::make('name')->required(),
                TextInput::make('email')->email()->required(),
                // ...
            ]);
    }
    ```
</Aside>

### Hiding components based on the current operation

The `hiddenOn()` method of form components allows you to dynamically hide fields based on the current page or action.

In this example, we hide the `password` field on the `edit` page:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Operation;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->required()
    ->hiddenOn(Operation::Edit),
```

Alternatively, we have a `visibleOn()` shortcut method for only showing a field on one page or action:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Operation;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->required()
    ->visibleOn(Operation::Create),
```

## Resource tables

Resource classes contain a `table()` method that is used to build the table on the [List page](listing-records).

By default, Filament creates a table file for you, which is referenced in the `table()` method. This is to keep your resource class clean and organized, otherwise it can get quite large:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Schemas\CustomersTable;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return CustomersTable::configure($table);
}
```

In the `CustomersTable` class, you can define the columns, filters and actions of the table:

```php
use Filament\Actions\BulkActionGroup;
use Filament\Actions\DeleteBulkAction;
use Filament\Actions\EditAction;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public static function configure(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('name'),
            TextColumn::make('email'),
            // ...
        ])
        ->filters([
            Filter::make('verified')
                ->query(fn (Builder $query): Builder => $query->whereNotNull('email_verified_at')),
            // ...
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            EditAction::make(),
        ])
        ->toolbarActions([
            BulkActionGroup::make([
                DeleteBulkAction::make(),
            ]),
        ]);
}
```

Check out the [tables](../tables) docs to find out how to add table columns, filters, actions and more.

<Aside variant="tip">
    If you would prefer to define the table directly in the resource class, you can do so and delete the table class altogether:

    ```php
    use Filament\Actions\BulkActionGroup;
    use Filament\Actions\DeleteBulkAction;
    use Filament\Actions\EditAction;
    use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
    use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
    use Filament\Tables\Table;
    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
    
    public static function table(Table $table): Table
    {
        return $table
            ->columns([
                TextColumn::make('name'),
                TextColumn::make('email'),
                // ...
            ])
            ->filters([
                Filter::make('verified')
                    ->query(fn (Builder $query): Builder => $query->whereNotNull('email_verified_at')),
                // ...
            ])
            ->recordActions([
                EditAction::make(),
            ])
            ->toolbarActions([
                BulkActionGroup::make([
                    DeleteBulkAction::make(),
                ]),
            ]);
    }
    ```
</Aside>

## Customizing the model label

Each resource has a "model label" which is automatically generated from the model name. For example, an `App\Models\Customer` model will have a `customer` label.

The label is used in several parts of the UI, and you may customize it using the `$modelLabel` property:

```php
protected static ?string $modelLabel = 'cliente';
```

Alternatively, you may use the `getModelLabel()` to define a dynamic label:

```php
public static function getModelLabel(): string
{
    return __('filament/resources/customer.label');
}
```

### Customizing the plural model label

Resources also have a "plural model label" which is automatically generated from the model label. For example, a `customer` label will be pluralized into `customers`.

You may customize the plural version of the label using the `$pluralModelLabel` property:

```php
protected static ?string $pluralModelLabel = 'clientes';
```

Alternatively, you may set a dynamic plural label in the `getPluralModelLabel()` method:

```php
public static function getPluralModelLabel(): string
{
    return __('filament/resources/customer.plural_label');
}
```

### Automatic model label capitalization

By default, Filament will automatically capitalize each word in the model label, for some parts of the UI. For example, in page titles, the navigation menu, and the breadcrumbs.

If you want to disable this behavior for a resource, you can set `$hasTitleCaseModelLabel` in the resource:

```php
protected static bool $hasTitleCaseModelLabel = false;
```

## Resource navigation items

Filament will automatically generate a navigation menu item for your resource using the [plural label](#plural-label).

If you'd like to customize the navigation item label, you may use the `$navigationLabel` property:

```php
protected static ?string $navigationLabel = 'Mis Clientes';
```

Alternatively, you may set a dynamic navigation label in the `getNavigationLabel()` method:

```php
public static function getNavigationLabel(): string
{
    return __('filament/resources/customer.navigation_label');
}
```

### Setting a resource navigation icon

The `$navigationIcon` property supports the name of any Blade component. By default, [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com) are installed. However, you may create your own custom icon components or install an alternative library if you wish.

```php
use BackedEnum;

protected static string | BackedEnum | null $navigationIcon = 'heroicon-o-user-group';
```

Alternatively, you may set a dynamic navigation icon in the `getNavigationIcon()` method:

```php
use BackedEnum;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable;

public static function getNavigationIcon(): string | BackedEnum | Htmlable | null
{
    return 'heroicon-o-user-group';
}
```

### Sorting resource navigation items

The `$navigationSort` property allows you to specify the order in which navigation items are listed:

```php
protected static ?int $navigationSort = 2;
```

Alternatively, you may set a dynamic navigation item order in the `getNavigationSort()` method:

```php
public static function getNavigationSort(): ?int
{
    return 2;
}
```

### Grouping resource navigation items

You may group navigation items by specifying a `$navigationGroup` property:

```php
use UnitEnum;

protected static string | UnitEnum | null $navigationGroup = 'Shop';
```

Alternatively, you may use the `getNavigationGroup()` method to set a dynamic group label:

```php
public static function getNavigationGroup(): ?string
{
    return __('filament/navigation.groups.shop');
}
```

#### Grouping resource navigation items under other items

You may group navigation items as children of other items, by passing the label of the parent item as the `$navigationParentItem`:

```php
use UnitEnum;

protected static ?string $navigationParentItem = 'Products';

protected static string | UnitEnum | null $navigationGroup = 'Shop';
```

As seen above, if the parent item has a navigation group, that navigation group must also be defined, so the correct parent item can be identified.

You may also use the `getNavigationParentItem()` method to set a dynamic parent item label:

```php
public static function getNavigationParentItem(): ?string
{
    return __('filament/navigation.groups.shop.items.products');
}
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    If you're reaching for a third level of navigation like this, you should consider using [clusters](../navigation/clusters) instead, which are a logical grouping of resources and [custom pages](../navigation/custom-pages), which can share their own separate navigation.
</Aside>

## Generating URLs to resource pages

Filament provides `getUrl()` static method on resource classes to generate URLs to resources and specific pages within them. Traditionally, you would need to construct the URL by hand or by using Laravel's `route()` helper, but these methods depend on knowledge of the resource's slug or route naming conventions.

The `getUrl()` method, without any arguments, will generate a URL to the resource's [List page](listing-records):

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\CustomerResource;

CustomerResource::getUrl(); // /admin/customers
```

You may also generate URLs to specific pages within the resource. The name of each page is the array key in the `getPages()` array of the resource. For example, to generate a URL to the [Create page](creating-records):

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\CustomerResource;

CustomerResource::getUrl('create'); // /admin/customers/create
```

Some pages in the `getPages()` method use URL parameters like `record`. To generate a URL to these pages and pass in a record, you should use the second argument:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\CustomerResource;

CustomerResource::getUrl('edit', ['record' => $customer]); // /admin/customers/edit/1
```

In this example, `$customer` can be an Eloquent model object, or an ID.

### Generating URLs to resource modals

This can be especially useful if you are using [simple resources](#simple-modal-resources) with only one page.

To generate a URL for an action in the resource's table, you should pass the `tableAction` and `tableActionRecord` as URL parameters:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\CustomerResource;
use Filament\Actions\EditAction;

CustomerResource::getUrl(parameters: [
    'tableAction' => EditAction::getDefaultName(),
    'tableActionRecord' => $customer,
]); // /admin/customers?tableAction=edit&tableActionRecord=1
```

Or if you want to generate a URL for an action on the page like a `CreateAction` in the header, you can pass it in to the `action` parameter:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\CustomerResource;
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;

CustomerResource::getUrl(parameters: [
    'action' => CreateAction::getDefaultName(),
]); // /admin/customers?action=create
```

### Generating URLs to resources in other panels

If you have multiple panels in your app, `getUrl()` will generate a URL within the current panel. You can also indicate which panel the resource is associated with, by passing the panel ID to the `panel` argument:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\CustomerResource;

CustomerResource::getUrl(panel: 'marketing');
```

## Customizing the resource Eloquent query

Within Filament, every query to your resource model will start with the `getEloquentQuery()` method.

Because of this, it's very easy to apply your own query constraints or [model scopes](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#query-scopes) that affect the entire resource:

```php
public static function getEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    return parent::getEloquentQuery()->where('is_active', true);
}
```

### Disabling global scopes

By default, Filament will observe all global scopes that are registered to your model. However, this may not be ideal if you wish to access, for example, soft-deleted records.

To overcome this, you may override the `getEloquentQuery()` method that Filament uses:

```php
public static function getEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    return parent::getEloquentQuery()->withoutGlobalScopes();
}
```

Alternatively, you may remove specific global scopes:

```php
public static function getEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    return parent::getEloquentQuery()->withoutGlobalScopes([ActiveScope::class]);
}
```

More information about removing global scopes may be found in the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#removing-global-scopes).

## Customizing the resource URL

By default, Filament will generate a URL based on the name of the resource. You can customize this by setting the `$slug` property on the resource:

```php
protected static ?string $slug = 'pending-orders';
```

## Resource sub-navigation

Sub-navigation allows the user to navigate between different pages within a resource. Typically, all pages in the sub-navigation will be related to the same record in the resource. For example, in a Customer resource, you may have a sub-navigation with the following pages:

- View customer, a [`ViewRecord` page](viewing-records) that provides a read-only view of the customer's details.
- Edit customer, an [`EditRecord` page](editing-records) that allows the user to edit the customer's details.
- Edit customer contact, an [`EditRecord` page](editing-records) that allows the user to edit the customer's contact details. You can [learn how to create more than one Edit page](editing-records#creating-another-edit-page).
- Manage addresses, a [`ManageRelatedRecords` page](managing-relationships#relation-pages) that allows the user to manage the customer's addresses.
- Manage payments, a [`ManageRelatedRecords` page](managing-relationships#relation-pages) that allows the user to manage the customer's payments.

To add a sub-navigation to each "singular record" page in the resource, you can add the `getRecordSubNavigation()` method to the resource class:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Pages\Page;

public static function getRecordSubNavigation(Page $page): array
{
    return $page->generateNavigationItems([
        ViewCustomer::class,
        EditCustomer::class,
        EditCustomerContact::class,
        ManageCustomerAddresses::class,
        ManageCustomerPayments::class,
    ]);
}
```

Each item in the sub-navigation can be customized using the [same navigation methods as normal pages](../navigation).

<Aside variant="tip">
    If you're looking to add sub-navigation to switch *between* entire resources and [custom pages](../navigation/custom-pages), you might be looking for [clusters](../navigation/clusters), which are used to group these together. The `getRecordSubNavigation()` method is intended to construct a navigation between pages that relate to a particular record *inside* a resource.
</Aside>

### Setting the sub-navigation position for a resource

The sub-navigation is rendered at the start of the page by default. You may change the position for all pages in a resource by setting the `$subNavigationPosition` property on the resource. The value may be `SubNavigationPosition::Start`, `SubNavigationPosition::End`, or `SubNavigationPosition::Top` to render the sub-navigation as tabs:

```php
use Filament\Pages\Enums\SubNavigationPosition;

protected static ?SubNavigationPosition $subNavigationPosition = SubNavigationPosition::End;
```

## Deleting resource pages

If you'd like to delete a page from your resource, you can just delete the page file from the `Pages` directory of your resource, and its entry in the `getPages()` method.

For example, you may have a resource with records that may not be created by anyone. Delete the `Create` page file, and then remove it from `getPages()`:

```php
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        'index' => ListCustomers::route('/'),
        'edit' => EditCustomer::route('/{record}/edit'),
    ];
}
```

Deleting a page will not delete any actions that link to that page. Any actions will open a modal instead of sending the user to the non-existent page. For instance, the `CreateAction` on the List page, the `EditAction` on the table or View page, or the `ViewAction` on the table or Edit page. If you want to remove those buttons, you must delete the actions as well.

## Security

## Authorization

For authorization, Filament will observe any [model policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies) that are registered in your app. The following methods are used:

- `viewAny()` is used to completely hide resources from the navigation menu, and prevents the user from accessing any pages.
- `create()` is used to control [creating new records](creating-records).
- `update()` is used to control [editing a record](editing-records).
- `view()` is used to control [viewing a record](viewing-records).
- `delete()` is used to prevent a single record from being deleted. `deleteAny()` is used to prevent records from being bulk deleted. Filament uses the `deleteAny()` method because iterating through multiple records and checking the `delete()` policy is not very performant. When using a `DeleteBulkAction`, if you want to call the `delete()` method for each record anyway, you should use the `DeleteBulkAction::make()->authorizeIndividualRecords()` method. Any records that fail the authorization check will not be processed.
- `forceDelete()` is used to prevent a single soft-deleted record from being force-deleted. `forceDeleteAny()` is used to prevent records from being bulk force-deleted. Filament uses the `forceDeleteAny()` method because iterating through multiple records and checking the `forceDelete()` policy is not very performant. When using a `ForceDeleteBulkAction`, if you want to call the `forceDelete()` method for each record anyway, you should use the `ForceDeleteBulkAction::make()->authorizeIndividualRecords()` method. Any records that fail the authorization check will not be processed.
- `restore()` is used to prevent a single soft-deleted record from being restored. `restoreAny()` is used to prevent records from being bulk restored. Filament uses the `restoreAny()` method because iterating through multiple records and checking the `restore()` policy is not very performant. When using a `RestoreBulkAction`, if you want to call the `restore()` method for each record anyway, you should use the `RestoreBulkAction::make()->authorizeIndividualRecords()` method. Any records that fail the authorization check will not be processed.
- `reorder()` is used to control [reordering records in a table](listing-records#reordering-records).

### Skipping authorization

If you'd like to skip authorization for a resource, you may set the `$shouldSkipAuthorization` property to `true`:

```php
protected static bool $shouldSkipAuthorization = true;
```

### Protecting model attributes

Filament will expose all model attributes to JavaScript, except if they are `$hidden` on your model. This is Livewire's behavior for model binding. We preserve this functionality to facilitate the dynamic addition and removal of form fields after they are initially loaded, while preserving the data they may need.

<Aside variant="danger">
    While attributes may be visible in JavaScript, only those with a form field are actually editable by the user. This is not an issue with mass assignment.
</Aside>

To remove certain attributes from JavaScript on the Edit and View pages, you may override [the `mutateFormDataBeforeFill()` method](editing-records#customizing-data-before-filling-the-form):

```php
protected function mutateFormDataBeforeFill(array $data): array
{
    unset($data['is_admin']);

    return $data;
}
```

In this example, we remove the `is_admin` attribute from JavaScript, as it's not being used by the form.

## Using tabs to filter the records

You can add tabs above the table, which can be used to filter the records based on some predefined conditions. Each tab can scope the Eloquent query of the table in a different way. To register tabs, add a `getTabs()` method to the List page class, and return an array of `Tab` objects:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function getTabs(): array
{
    return [
        'all' => Tab::make(),
        'active' => Tab::make()
            ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('active', true)),
        'inactive' => Tab::make()
            ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('active', false)),
    ];
}
```

### Customizing the filter tab labels

The keys of the array will be used as identifiers for the tabs, so they can be persisted in the URL's query string. The label of each tab is also generated from the key, but you can override that by passing a label into the `make()` method of the tab:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function getTabs(): array
{
    return [
        'all' => Tab::make('All customers'),
        'active' => Tab::make('Active customers')
            ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('active', true)),
        'inactive' => Tab::make('Inactive customers')
            ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('active', false)),
    ];
}
```

### Adding icons to filter tabs

You can add icons to the tabs by passing an [icon](../styling/icons) into the `icon()` method of the tab:

```php
use use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;

Tab::make()
    ->icon('heroicon-m-user-group')
```

You can also change the icon's position to be after the label instead of before it, using the `iconPosition()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\IconPosition;

Tab::make()
    ->icon('heroicon-m-user-group')
    ->iconPosition(IconPosition::After)
```

### Adding badges to filter tabs

You can add badges to the tabs by passing a string into the `badge()` method of the tab:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;

Tab::make()
    ->badge(Customer::query()->where('active', true)->count())
```

#### Changing the color of filter tab badges

The color of a badge may be changed using the `badgeColor()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;

Tab::make()
    ->badge(Customer::query()->where('active', true)->count())
    ->badgeColor('success')
```

### Adding extra attributes to filter tabs

You may also pass extra HTML attributes to filter tabs using `extraAttributes()`:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;

Tab::make()
    ->extraAttributes(['data-cy' => 'statement-confirmed-tab'])
```

### Customizing the default tab

To customize the default tab that is selected when the page is loaded, you can return the array key of the tab from the `getDefaultActiveTab()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;

public function getTabs(): array
{
    return [
        'all' => Tab::make(),
        'active' => Tab::make(),
        'inactive' => Tab::make(),
    ];
}

public function getDefaultActiveTab(): string | int | null
{
    return 'active';
}
```

## Authorization

For authorization, Filament will observe any [model policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies) that are registered in your app.

Users may access the List page if the `viewAny()` method of the model policy returns `true`.

The `reorder()` method is used to control [reordering a record](#reordering-records).

## Customizing the table Eloquent query

Although you can [customize the Eloquent query for the entire resource](overview#customizing-the-resource-eloquent-query), you may also make specific modifications for the List page table. To do this, use the `modifyQueryUsing()` method in the `table()` method of the resource:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->withoutGlobalScopes());
}
```

## Custom page content

Each page in Filament has its own [schema](../schemas), which defines the overall structure and content. You can override the schema for the page by defining a `content()` method on it. The `content()` method for the List page contains the following components by default:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\EmbeddedTable;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\RenderHook;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function content(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            $this->getTabsContentComponent(), // This method returns a component to display the tabs above a table
            RenderHook::make(PanelsRenderHook::RESOURCE_PAGES_LIST_RECORDS_TABLE_BEFORE),
            EmbeddedTable::make(), // This is the component that renders the table that is defined in this resource
            RenderHook::make(PanelsRenderHook::RESOURCE_PAGES_LIST_RECORDS_TABLE_AFTER),
        ]);
}
```

Inside the `components()` array, you can insert any [schema component](../schemas). You can reorder the components by changing the order of the array or remove any of the components that are not needed.

### Using a custom Blade view

For further customization opportunities, you can override the static `$view` property on the page class to a custom view in your app:

```php
protected string $view = 'filament.resources.users.pages.list-users';
```

This assumes that you have created a view at `resources/views/filament/resources/users/pages/list-users.blade.php`:

```blade
<x-filament-panels::page>
    {{ $this->content }} {{-- This will render the content of the page defined in the `content()` method, which can be removed if you want to start from scratch --}}
</x-filament-panels::page>
```

title: Creating records

## Customizing data before saving

Sometimes, you may wish to modify form data before it is finally saved to the database. To do this, you may define a `mutateFormDataBeforeCreate()` method on the Create page class, which accepts the `$data` as an array, and returns the modified version:

```php
protected function mutateFormDataBeforeCreate(array $data): array
{
    $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

    return $data;
}
```

Alternatively, if you're creating records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../actions/create#customizing-data-before-saving).

## Customizing the creation process

You can tweak how the record is created using the `handleRecordCreation()` method on the Create page class:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

protected function handleRecordCreation(array $data): Model
{
    return static::getModel()::create($data);
}
```

Alternatively, if you're creating records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../actions/create#customizing-the-creation-process).

## Customizing redirects

By default, after saving the form, the user will be redirected to the [Edit page](editing-records) of the resource, or the [View page](viewing-records) if it is present.

You may set up a custom redirect when the form is saved by overriding the `getRedirectUrl()` method on the Create page class.

For example, the form can redirect back to the [List page](listing-records):

```php
protected function getRedirectUrl(): string
{
    return $this->getResource()::getUrl('index');
}
```

If you wish to be redirected to the previous page, else the index page:

```php
protected function getRedirectUrl(): string
{
    return $this->previousUrl ?? $this->getResource()::getUrl('index');
}
```

You can also use the [configuration](../panel-configuration) to customize the default redirect page for all resources at once:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->resourceCreatePageRedirect('index') // or
        ->resourceCreatePageRedirect('view') // or
        ->resourceCreatePageRedirect('edit');
}
```

## Customizing the save notification

When the record is successfully created, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the title of this notification, define a `getCreatedNotificationTitle()` method on the create page class:

```php
protected function getCreatedNotificationTitle(): ?string
{
    return 'User registered';
}
```

Alternatively, if you're creating records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../actions/create#customizing-the-save-notification).

You may customize the entire notification by overriding the `getCreatedNotification()` method on the create page class:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

protected function getCreatedNotification(): ?Notification
{
    return Notification::make()
        ->success()
        ->title('User registered')
        ->body('The user has been created successfully.');
}
```

To disable the notification altogether, return `null` from the `getCreatedNotification()` method on the create page class:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

protected function getCreatedNotification(): ?Notification
{
    return null;
}
```

## Creating another record

### Disabling create another

To disable the "create and create another" feature, define the `$canCreateAnother` property as `false` on the Create page class:

```php
protected static bool $canCreateAnother = false;
```

Alternatively, if you'd like to specify a dynamic condition when the feature is disabled, you may override the `canCreateAnother()` method on the Create page class:

```php
public function canCreateAnother(): bool
{
    return false;
}
```

### Preserving data when creating another

By default, when the user uses the "create and create another" feature, all the form data is cleared so the user can start fresh. If you'd like to preserve some of the data in the form, you may override the `preserveFormDataWhenCreatingAnother()` method on the Create page class, and return the part of the `$data` array that you'd like to keep:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Arr;

protected function preserveFormDataWhenCreatingAnother(array $data): array
{
    return Arr::only($data, ['is_admin', 'organization']);
}
```

To preserve all the data, return the entire `$data` array:

```php
protected function preserveFormDataWhenCreatingAnother(array $data): array
{
    return $data;
}
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within a page's lifecycle, like before a form is saved. To set up a hook, create a protected method on the Create page class with the name of the hook:

```php
protected function beforeCreate(): void
{
    // ...
}
```

In this example, the code in the `beforeCreate()` method will be called before the data in the form is saved to the database.

There are several available hooks for the Create page:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Pages\CreateRecord;

class CreateUser extends CreateRecord
{
    // ...

    protected function beforeFill(): void
    {
        // Runs before the form fields are populated with their default values.
    }

    protected function afterFill(): void
    {
        // Runs after the form fields are populated with their default values.
    }

    protected function beforeValidate(): void
    {
        // Runs before the form fields are validated when the form is submitted.
    }

    protected function afterValidate(): void
    {
        // Runs after the form fields are validated when the form is submitted.
    }

    protected function beforeCreate(): void
    {
        // Runs before the form fields are saved to the database.
    }

    protected function afterCreate(): void
    {
        // Runs after the form fields are saved to the database.
    }
}
```

Alternatively, if you're creating records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../actions/create#lifecycle-hooks).

## Halting the creation process

At any time, you may call `$this->halt()` from inside a lifecycle hook or mutation method, which will halt the entire creation process:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

protected function beforeCreate(): void
{
    if (! auth()->user()->team->subscribed()) {
        Notification::make()
            ->warning()
            ->title('You don\'t have an active subscription!')
            ->body('Choose a plan to continue.')
            ->persistent()
            ->actions([
                Action::make('subscribe')
                    ->button()
                    ->url(route('subscribe'), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
            ])
            ->send();
    
        $this->halt();
    }
}
```

Alternatively, if you're creating records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../actions/create#halting-the-creation-process).

## Authorization

For authorization, Filament will observe any [model policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies) that are registered in your app.

Users may access the Create page if the `create()` method of the model policy returns `true`.

## Using a wizard

You may easily transform the creation process into a multistep wizard.

On the page class, add the corresponding `HasWizard` trait:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Categories\CategoryResource;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\CreateRecord;

class CreateCategory extends CreateRecord
{
    use CreateRecord\Concerns\HasWizard;
    
    protected static string $resource = CategoryResource::class;

    protected function getSteps(): array
    {
        return [
            // ...
        ];
    }
}
```

Inside the `getSteps()` array, return your [wizard steps](../schemas/wizards):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard\Step;

protected function getSteps(): array
{
    return [
        Step::make('Name')
            ->description('Give the category a clear and unique name')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('name')
                    ->required()
                    ->live()
                    ->afterStateUpdated(fn ($state, callable $set) => $set('slug', Str::slug($state))),
                TextInput::make('slug')
                    ->disabled()
                    ->required()
                    ->unique(Category::class, 'slug', fn ($record) => $record),
            ]),
        Step::make('Description')
            ->description('Add some extra details')
            ->schema([
                MarkdownEditor::make('description')
                    ->columnSpan('full'),
            ]),
        Step::make('Visibility')
            ->description('Control who can view it')
            ->schema([
                Toggle::make('is_visible')
                    ->label('Visible to customers.')
                    ->default(true),
            ]),
    ];
}
```

Alternatively, if you're creating records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../actions/create#using-a-wizard).

Now, create a new record to see your wizard in action! Edit will still use the form defined within the resource class.

If you'd like to allow free navigation, so all the steps are skippable, override the `hasSkippableSteps()` method:

```php
public function hasSkippableSteps(): bool
{
    return true;
}
```

### Sharing fields between the form schema and wizards

If you'd like to reduce the amount of repetition between the resource form and wizard steps, it's a good idea to extract public static form functions for your fields, where you can easily retrieve an instance of a field from the form schema or the wizard:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

class CategoryForm
{
    public static function configure(Schema $schema): Schema
    {
        return $schema
            ->components([
                static::getNameFormField(),
                static::getSlugFormField(),
                // ...
            ]);
    }
    
    public static function getNameFormField(): Forms\Components\TextInput
    {
        return TextInput::make('name')
            ->required()
            ->live()
            ->afterStateUpdated(fn ($state, callable $set) => $set('slug', Str::slug($state)));
    }
    
    public static function getSlugFormField(): Forms\Components\TextInput
    {
        return TextInput::make('slug')
            ->disabled()
            ->required()
            ->unique(Category::class, 'slug', fn ($record) => $record);
    }
}
```

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Categories\Schemas\CategoryForm;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\CreateRecord;

class CreateCategory extends CreateRecord
{
    use CreateRecord\Concerns\HasWizard;
    
    protected static string $resource = CategoryResource::class;

    protected function getSteps(): array
    {
        return [
            Step::make('Name')
                ->description('Give the category a clear and unique name')
                ->schema([
                    CategoryForm::getNameFormField(),
                    CategoryForm::getSlugFormField(),
                ]),
            // ...
        ];
    }
}
```

## Importing resource records

Filament includes an `ImportAction` that you can add to the `getHeaderActions()` of the [List page](listing-records). It allows users to upload a CSV of data to import into the resource:

```php
use App\Filament\Imports\ProductImporter;
use Filament\Actions;

protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        Actions\ImportAction::make()
            ->importer(ProductImporter::class),
        Actions\CreateAction::make(),
    ];
}
```

The "importer" class [needs to be created](../actions/import#creating-an-importer) to tell Filament how to import each row of the CSV. You can learn everything about the `ImportAction` in the [Actions documentation](../actions/import).

## Custom actions

"Actions" are buttons that are displayed on pages, which allow the user to run a Livewire method on the page or visit a URL.

On resource pages, actions are usually in 2 places: in the top right of the page, and below the form.

For example, you may add a new button action in the header of the Create page:

```php
use App\Filament\Imports\UserImporter;
use Filament\Actions;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\CreateRecord;

class CreateUser extends CreateRecord
{
    // ...

    protected function getHeaderActions(): array
    {
        return [
            Actions\ImportAction::make()
                ->importer(UserImporter::class),
        ];
    }
}
```

Or, a new button next to "Create" below the form:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\CreateRecord;

class CreateUser extends CreateRecord
{
    // ...

    protected function getFormActions(): array
    {
        return [
            ...parent::getFormActions(),
            Action::make('close')->action('createAndClose'),
        ];
    }

    public function createAndClose(): void
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

To view the entire actions API, please visit the [pages section](../navigation/custom-pages#adding-actions-to-pages).

### Adding a create action button to the header

The "Create" button can be moved to the header of the page by overriding the `getHeaderActions()` method and using `getCreateFormAction()`. You need to pass `formId()` to the action, to specify that the action should submit the form with the ID of `form`, which is the `<form>` ID used in the view of the page:

```php
protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        $this->getCreateFormAction()
            ->formId('form'),
    ];
}
```

You may remove all actions from the form by overriding the `getFormActions()` method to return an empty array:

```php
protected function getFormActions(): array
{
    return [];
}
```

## Custom page content

Each page in Filament has its own [schema](../schemas), which defines the overall structure and content. You can override the schema for the page by defining a `content()` method on it. The `content()` method for the Create page contains the following components by default:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function content(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            $this->getFormContentComponent(), // This method returns a component to display the form that is defined in this resource
        ]);
}
```

Inside the `components()` array, you can insert any [schema component](../schemas). You can reorder the components by changing the order of the array or remove any of the components that are not needed.

### Using a custom Blade view

For further customization opportunities, you can override the static `$view` property on the page class to a custom view in your app:

```php
protected string $view = 'filament.resources.users.pages.create-user';
```

This assumes that you have created a view at `resources/views/filament/resources/users/pages/create-user.blade.php`:

```blade
<x-filament-panels::page>
    {{ $this->content }} {{-- This will render the content of the page defined in the `content()` method, which can be removed if you want to start from scratch --}}
</x-filament-panels::page>
```

title: Editing records
---

## Customizing data before filling the form

You may wish to modify the data from a record before it is filled into the form. To do this, you may define a `mutateFormDataBeforeFill()` method on the Edit page class to modify the `$data` array, and return the modified version before it is filled into the form:

```php
protected function mutateFormDataBeforeFill(array $data): array
{
    $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

    return $data;
}
```

Alternatively, if you're editing records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../actions/edit#customizing-data-before-filling-the-form).

## Customizing data before saving

Sometimes, you may wish to modify form data before it is finally saved to the database. To do this, you may define a `mutateFormDataBeforeSave()` method on the Edit page class, which accepts the `$data` as an array, and returns it modified:

```php
protected function mutateFormDataBeforeSave(array $data): array
{
    $data['last_edited_by_id'] = auth()->id();

    return $data;
}
```

Alternatively, if you're editing records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../actions/edit#customizing-data-before-saving).

## Customizing the saving process

You can tweak how the record is updated using the `handleRecordUpdate()` method on the Edit page class:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

protected function handleRecordUpdate(Model $record, array $data): Model
{
    $record->update($data);

    return $record;
}
```

Alternatively, if you're editing records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../actions/edit#customizing-the-saving-process).

## Customizing redirects

By default, saving the form will not redirect the user to another page.

You may set up a custom redirect when the form is saved by overriding the `getRedirectUrl()` method on the Edit page class.

For example, the form can redirect back to the [List page](listing-records) of the resource:

```php
protected function getRedirectUrl(): string
{
    return $this->getResource()::getUrl('index');
}
```

Or the [View page](viewing-records):

```php
protected function getRedirectUrl(): string
{
    return $this->getResource()::getUrl('view', ['record' => $this->getRecord()]);
}
```

If you wish to be redirected to the previous page, else the index page:

```php
protected function getRedirectUrl(): string
{
    return $this->previousUrl ?? $this->getResource()::getUrl('index');
}
```

You can also use the [configuration](../panel-configuration) to customize the default redirect page for all resources at once:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->resourceEditPageRedirect('index') // or
        ->resourceEditPageRedirect('view');
}
```

## Customizing the save notification

When the record is successfully updated, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the title of this notification, define a `getSavedNotificationTitle()` method on the edit page class:

```php
protected function getSavedNotificationTitle(): ?string
{
    return 'User updated';
}
```

Alternatively, if you're editing records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../actions/edit#customizing-the-save-notification).

You may customize the entire notification by overriding the `getSavedNotification()` method on the edit page class:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

protected function getSavedNotification(): ?Notification
{
    return Notification::make()
        ->success()
        ->title('User updated')
        ->body('The user has been saved successfully.');
}
```

To disable the notification altogether, return `null` from the `getSavedNotification()` method on the edit page class:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

protected function getSavedNotification(): ?Notification
{
    return null;
}
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within a page's lifecycle, like before a form is saved. To set up a hook, create a protected method on the Edit page class with the name of the hook:

```php
protected function beforeSave(): void
{
    // ...
}
```

In this example, the code in the `beforeSave()` method will be called before the data in the form is saved to the database.

There are several available hooks for the Edit pages:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Pages\EditRecord;

class EditUser extends EditRecord
{
    // ...

    protected function beforeFill(): void
    {
        // Runs before the form fields are populated from the database.
    }

    protected function afterFill(): void
    {
        // Runs after the form fields are populated from the database.
    }

    protected function beforeValidate(): void
    {
        // Runs before the form fields are validated when the form is saved.
    }

    protected function afterValidate(): void
    {
        // Runs after the form fields are validated when the form is saved.
    }

    protected function beforeSave(): void
    {
        // Runs before the form fields are saved to the database.
    }

    protected function afterSave(): void
    {
        // Runs after the form fields are saved to the database.
    }
}
```

Alternatively, if you're editing records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../actions/edit#lifecycle-hooks).

## Saving a part of the form independently

You may want to allow the user to save a part of the form independently of the rest of the form. One way to do this is with a [section action in the header or footer](../schemas/sections#adding-actions-to-the-sections-header-or-footer). From the `action()` method, you can call `saveFormComponentOnly()`, passing in the `Section` component that you want to save:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\EditRecord;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->footerActions([
        fn (string $operation): Action => Action::make('save')
            ->action(function (Section $component, EditRecord $livewire) {
                $livewire->saveFormComponentOnly($component);
                
                Notification::make()
                    ->title('Rate limiting saved')
                    ->body('The rate limiting settings have been saved successfully.')
                    ->success()
                    ->send();
            })
            ->visible($operation === 'edit'),
    ])
```

The `$operation` helper is available, to ensure that the action is only visible when the form is being edited.

## Halting the saving process

At any time, you may call `$this->halt()` from inside a lifecycle hook or mutation method, which will halt the entire saving process:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

protected function beforeSave(): void
{
    if (! $this->getRecord()->team->subscribed()) {
        Notification::make()
            ->warning()
            ->title('You don\'t have an active subscription!')
            ->body('Choose a plan to continue.')
            ->persistent()
            ->actions([
                Action::make('subscribe')
                    ->button()
                    ->url(route('subscribe'), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
            ])
            ->send();

        $this->halt();
    }
}
```

Alternatively, if you're editing records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../actions/edit#halting-the-saving-process).

## Authorization

For authorization, Filament will observe any [model policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies) that are registered in your app.

Users may access the Edit page if the `update()` method of the model policy returns `true`.

They also have the ability to delete the record if the `delete()` method of the policy returns `true`.

## Custom actions

"Actions" are buttons that are displayed on pages, which allow the user to run a Livewire method on the page or visit a URL.

On resource pages, actions are usually in 2 places: in the top right of the page, and below the form.

For example, you may add a new button action next to "Delete" on the Edit page:

```php
use Filament\Actions;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\EditRecord;

class EditUser extends EditRecord
{
    // ...

    protected function getHeaderActions(): array
    {
        return [
            Actions\Action::make('impersonate')
                ->action(function (): void {
                    // ...
                }),
            Actions\DeleteAction::make(),
        ];
    }
}
```

Or, a new button next to "Save" below the form:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\EditRecord;

class EditUser extends EditRecord
{
    // ...

    protected function getFormActions(): array
    {
        return [
            ...parent::getFormActions(),
            Action::make('close')->action('saveAndClose'),
        ];
    }

    public function saveAndClose(): void
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

To view the entire actions API, please visit the [pages section](../navigation/custom-pages#adding-actions-to-pages).

### Adding a save action button to the header

The "Save" button can be added to the header of the page by overriding the `getHeaderActions()` method and using `getSaveFormAction()`. You need to pass `formId()` to the action, to specify that the action should submit the form with the ID of `form`, which is the `<form>` ID used in the view of the page:

```php
protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        $this->getSaveFormAction()
            ->formId('form'),
    ];
}
```

You may remove all actions from the form by overriding the `getFormActions()` method to return an empty array:

```php
protected function getFormActions(): array
{
    return [];
}
```

## Creating another Edit page

One Edit page may not be enough space to allow users to navigate many form fields. You can create as many Edit pages for a resource as you want. This is especially useful if you are using [resource sub-navigation](overview#resource-sub-navigation), as you are then easily able to switch between the different Edit pages.

To create an Edit page, you should use the `make:filament-page` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-page EditCustomerContact --resource=CustomerResource --type=EditRecord
```

You must register this new page in your resource's `getPages()` method:

```php
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        'index' => Pages\ListCustomers::route('/'),
        'create' => Pages\CreateCustomer::route('/create'),
        'view' => Pages\ViewCustomer::route('/{record}'),
        'edit' => Pages\EditCustomer::route('/{record}/edit'),
        'edit-contact' => Pages\EditCustomerContact::route('/{record}/edit/contact'),
    ];
}
```

Now, you can define the `form()` for this page, which can contain other fields that are not present on the main Edit page:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Adding edit pages to resource sub-navigation

If you're using [resource sub-navigation](overview#resource-sub-navigation), you can register this page as normal in `getRecordSubNavigation()` of the resource:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Pages;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\Page;

public static function getRecordSubNavigation(Page $page): array
{
    return $page->generateNavigationItems([
        // ...
        Pages\EditCustomerContact::class,
    ]);
}
```

## Custom page content

Each page in Filament has its own [schema](../schemas), which defines the overall structure and content. You can override the schema for the page by defining a `content()` method on it. The `content()` method for the Edit page contains the following components by default:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function content(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            $this->getFormContentComponent(), // This method returns a component to display the form that is defined in this resource
            $this->getRelationManagersContentComponent(), // This method returns a component to display the relation managers that are defined in this resource
        ]);
}
```

Inside the `components()` array, you can insert any [schema component](../schemas). You can reorder the components by changing the order of the array or remove any of the components that are not needed.

### Using a custom Blade view

For further customization opportunities, you can override the static `$view` property on the page class to a custom view in your app:

```php
protected string $view = 'filament.resources.users.pages.edit-user';
```

This assumes that you have created a view at `resources/views/filament/resources/users/pages/edit-user.blade.php`:

```blade
<x-filament-panels::page>
    {{-- `$this->getRecord()` will return the current Eloquent record for this page --}}
    
    {{ $this->content }} {{-- This will render the content of the page defined in the `content()` method, which can be removed if you want to start from scratch --}}
</x-filament-panels::page>
```

title: Viewing records

## Creating a resource with a View page

To create a new resource with a View page, you can use the `--view` flag:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource User --view
```

## Using an infolist instead of a disabled form

By default, the View page will display a disabled form with the record's data. If you preferred to display the record's data in an "infolist", you can define an `infolist()` method on the resource class:

```php
use Filament\Infolists;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public static function infolist(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            Infolists\Components\TextEntry::make('name'),
            Infolists\Components\TextEntry::make('email'),
            Infolists\Components\TextEntry::make('notes')
                ->columnSpanFull(),
        ]);
}
```

The `components()` method is used to define the structure of your infolist. It is an array of [entries](../infolists#available-entries) and [layout components](../schemas/layout#available-layout-components), in the order they should appear in your infolist.

Check out the Infolists docs for a [guide](../infolists) on how to build infolists with Filament.

## Adding a View page to an existing resource

If you want to add a View page to an existing resource, create a new page in your resource's `Pages` directory:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-page ViewUser --resource=UserResource --type=ViewRecord
```

You must register this new page in your resource's `getPages()` method:

```php
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        'index' => Pages\ListUsers::route('/'),
        'create' => Pages\CreateUser::route('/create'),
        'view' => Pages\ViewUser::route('/{record}'),
        'edit' => Pages\EditUser::route('/{record}/edit'),
    ];
}
```

## Viewing records in modals

If your resource is simple, you may wish to view records in modals rather than on the [View page](viewing-records). If this is the case, you can just [delete the view page](overview#deleting-resource-pages).

If your resource doesn't contain a `ViewAction`, you can add one to the `$table->recordActions()` array:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ViewAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            ViewAction::make(),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing data before filling the form

You may wish to modify the data from a record before it is filled into the form. To do this, you may define a `mutateFormDataBeforeFill()` method on the View page class to modify the `$data` array, and return the modified version before it is filled into the form:

```php
protected function mutateFormDataBeforeFill(array $data): array
{
    $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

    return $data;
}
```

Alternatively, if you're viewing records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../actions/view#customizing-data-before-filling-the-form).

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within a page's lifecycle, like before a form is filled. To set up a hook, create a protected method on the View page class with the name of the hook:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Pages\ViewRecord;

class ViewUser extends ViewRecord
{
    // ...

    protected function beforeFill(): void
    {
        // Runs before the disabled form fields are populated from the database. Not run on pages using an infolist.
    }

    protected function afterFill(): void
    {
        // Runs after the disabled form fields are populated from the database. Not run on pages using an infolist.
    }
}
```

## Authorization

For authorization, Filament will observe any [model policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies) that are registered in your app.

Users may access the View page if the `view()` method of the model policy returns `true`.

## Creating another View page

One View page may not be enough space to allow users to navigate a lot of information. You can create as many View pages for a resource as you want. This is especially useful if you are using [resource sub-navigation](overview#resource-sub-navigation), as you are then easily able to switch between the different View pages.

To create a View page, you should use the `make:filament-page` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-page ViewCustomerContact --resource=CustomerResource --type=ViewRecord
```

You must register this new page in your resource's `getPages()` method:

```php
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        'index' => Pages\ListCustomers::route('/'),
        'create' => Pages\CreateCustomer::route('/create'),
        'view' => Pages\ViewCustomer::route('/{record}'),
        'view-contact' => Pages\ViewCustomerContact::route('/{record}/contact'),
        'edit' => Pages\EditCustomer::route('/{record}/edit'),
    ];
}
```

Now, you can define the `infolist()` or `form()` for this page, which can contain other components that are not present on the main View page:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function infolist(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing relation managers for a specific view page

You can specify which relation managers should appear on a view page by defining a `getAllRelationManagers()` method:

```php
protected function getAllRelationManagers(): array
{
    return [
        CustomerAddressesRelationManager::class,
        CustomerContactsRelationManager::class,
    ];
}
```

This is useful when you have [multiple view pages](#creating-another-view-page) and need different relation managers on
each page:

```php
// ViewCustomer.php
protected function getAllRelationManagers(): array
{
    return [
        RelationManagers\OrdersRelationManager::class,
        RelationManagers\SubscriptionsRelationManager::class,
    ];
}

// ViewCustomerContact.php 
protected function getAllRelationManagers(): array
{
    return [
        RelationManagers\ContactsRelationManager::class,
        RelationManagers\AddressesRelationManager::class,
    ];
}
```

If `getAllRelationManagers()` isn't defined, any relation managers defined in the resource will be used.

## Adding view pages to resource sub-navigation

If you're using [resource sub-navigation](overview#resource-sub-navigation), you can register this page as normal in `getRecordSubNavigation()` of the resource:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Pages;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\Page;

public static function getRecordSubNavigation(Page $page): array
{
    return $page->generateNavigationItems([
        // ...
        Pages\ViewCustomerContact::class,
    ]);
}
```

## Custom page content

Each page in Filament has its own [schema](../schemas), which defines the overall structure and content. You can override the schema for the page by defining a `content()` method on it. The `content()` method for the View page contains the following components by default:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function content(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            $this->hasInfolist() // This method returns `true` if the page has an infolist defined
                ? $this->getInfolistContentComponent() // This method returns a component to display the infolist that is defined in this resource
                : $this->getFormContentComponent(), // This method returns a component to display the form that is defined in this resource
            $this->getRelationManagersContentComponent(), // This method returns a component to display the relation managers that are defined in this resource
        ]);
}
```

Inside the `components()` array, you can insert any [schema component](../schemas). You can reorder the components by changing the order of the array or remove any of the components that are not needed.

### Using a custom Blade view

For further customization opportunities, you can override the static `$view` property on the page class to a custom view in your app:

```php
protected string $view = 'filament.resources.users.pages.view-user';
```

This assumes that you have created a view at `resources/views/filament/resources/users/pages/view-user.blade.php`:

```blade
<x-filament-panels::page>
    {{-- `$this->getRecord()` will return the current Eloquent record for this page --}}
    
    {{ $this->content }} {{-- This will render the content of the page defined in the `content()` method, which can be removed if you want to start from scratch --}}
</x-filament-panels::page>
```

title: Deleting records

## Handling soft-deletes

## Creating a resource with soft-delete

By default, you will not be able to interact with deleted records in the app. If you'd like to add functionality to restore, force-delete and filter trashed records in your resource, use the `--soft-deletes` flag when generating the resource:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer --soft-deletes
```

## Adding soft-deletes to an existing resource

Alternatively, you may add soft-deleting functionality to an existing resource.

Firstly, you must update the resource:

```php
use Filament\Actions\BulkActionGroup;
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
use Filament\Actions\DeleteBulkAction;
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteAction;
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteBulkAction;
use Filament\Actions\RestoreAction;
use Filament\Actions\RestoreBulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TrashedFilter;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletingScope;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filters([
            TrashedFilter::make(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            // You may add these actions to your table if you're using a simple
            // resource, or you just want to be able to delete records without
            // leaving the table.
            DeleteAction::make(),
            ForceDeleteAction::make(),
            RestoreAction::make(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->toolbarActions([
            BulkActionGroup::make([
                DeleteBulkAction::make(),
                ForceDeleteBulkAction::make(),
                RestoreBulkAction::make(),
                // ...
            ]),
        ]);
}

public static function getRecordRouteBindingEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    return parent::getRecordRouteBindingEloquentQuery()
        ->withoutGlobalScopes([
            SoftDeletingScope::class,
        ]);
}
```

Now, update the Edit page class if you have one:

```php
use Filament\Actions;

protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        Actions\DeleteAction::make(),
        Actions\ForceDeleteAction::make(),
        Actions\RestoreAction::make(),
        // ...
    ];
}
```

## Deleting records on the List page

By default, you can bulk-delete records in your table. You may also wish to delete single records, using a `DeleteAction`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            // ...
            DeleteAction::make(),
        ]);
}
```

## Authorization

For authorization, Filament will observe any [model policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies) that are registered in your app.

Users may delete records if the `delete()` method of the model policy returns `true`.

They also have the ability to bulk-delete records if the `deleteAny()` method of the policy returns `true`. Filament uses the `deleteAny()` method because iterating through multiple records and checking the `delete()` policy is not very performant.

You can use the `authorizeIndividualRecords()` method on the `BulkDeleteAction` to check the `delete()` policy for each record individually.

### Authorizing soft-deletes

The `forceDelete()` policy method is used to prevent a single soft-deleted record from being force-deleted. `forceDeleteAny()` is used to prevent records from being bulk force-deleted. Filament uses the `forceDeleteAny()` method because iterating through multiple records and checking the `forceDelete()` policy is not very performant.

The `restore()` policy method is used to prevent a single soft-deleted record from being restored. `restoreAny()` is used to prevent records from being bulk restored. Filament uses the `restoreAny()` method because iterating through multiple records and checking the `restore()` policy is not very performant.

## Choosing the right tool for the job

Filament provides many ways to manage relationships in the app. Which feature you should use depends on the type of relationship you are managing, and which UI you are looking for.

### Relation managers - interactive tables underneath your resource forms

<Aside variant="info">
    These are compatible with `HasMany`, `HasManyThrough`, `BelongsToMany`, `MorphMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships.
</Aside>

[Relation managers](#creating-a-relation-manager) are interactive tables that allow administrators to list, create, attach, associate, edit, detach, dissociate and delete related records without leaving the resource's Edit or View page.

### Select & checkbox list - choose from existing records or create a new one

<Aside variant="info">
    These are compatible with `BelongsTo`, `MorphTo` and `BelongsToMany` relationships.
</Aside>

Using a [select](../forms/select#integrating-with-an-eloquent-relationship), users will be able to choose from a list of existing records. You may also [add a button that allows you to create a new record inside a modal](../forms/select#creating-new-records), without leaving the page.

When using a `BelongsToMany` relationship with a select, you'll be able to select multiple options, not just one. Records will be automatically added to your pivot table when you submit the form. If you wish, you can swap out the multi-select dropdown with a simple [checkbox list](../forms/checkbox-list#integrating-with-an-eloquent-relationship). Both components work in the same way.

### Repeaters - CRUD multiple related records inside the owner's form

<Aside variant="info">
    These are compatible with `HasMany` and `MorphMany` relationships.
</Aside>

[Repeaters](../forms/repeater#integrating-with-an-eloquent-relationship) are standard form components, which can render a repeatable set of fields infinitely. They can be hooked up to a relationship, so records are automatically read, created, updated, and deleted from the related table. They live inside the main form schema, and can be used inside resource pages, as well as nesting within action modals.

From a UX perspective, this solution is only suitable if your related model only has a few fields. Otherwise, the form can get very long.

### Layout form components - saving form fields to a single relationship

<Aside variant="info">
    These are compatible with `BelongsTo`, `HasOne` and `MorphOne` relationships.
</Aside>

All layout form components ([Grid](../schemas/layouts#grid-component), [Section](../schemas/sections), [Fieldset](../schemas/layouts#fieldset-component), etc.) have a [`relationship()` method](../forms/overview#saving-data-to-relationships). When you use this, all fields within that layout are saved to the related model instead of the owner's model:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Fieldset;

Fieldset::make('Metadata')
    ->relationship('metadata')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('title'),
        Textarea::make('description'),
        FileUpload::make('image'),
    ])
```

In this example, the `title`, `description` and `image` are automatically loaded from the `metadata` relationship, and saved again when the form is submitted. If the `metadata` record does not exist, it is automatically created.

This feature is explained more in depth in the [Forms documentation](../forms/overview#saving-data-to-relationships). Please visit that page for more information about how to use it.

## Creating a relation manager

To create a relation manager, you can use the `make:filament-relation-manager` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title
```

- `CategoryResource` is the name of the resource class for the owner (parent) model.
- `posts` is the name of the relationship you want to manage.
- `title` is the name of the attribute that will be used to identify posts.

This will create a `CategoryResource/RelationManagers/PostsRelationManager.php` file. This contains a class where you are able to define a [form](overview#resource-forms) and [table](overview#resource-tables) for your relation manager:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('title')->required(),
            // ...
        ]);
}

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('title'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

You must register the new relation manager in your resource's `getRelations()` method:

```php
public static function getRelations(): array
{
    return [
        RelationManagers\PostsRelationManager::class,
    ];
}
```

Once a table and form have been defined for the relation manager, visit the [Edit](editing-records) or [View](viewing-records) page of your resource to see it in action.

### Customizing the relation manager's URL parameter

If you pass a key to the array returned from `getRelations()`, it will be used in the URL for that relation manager when switching been multiple relation managers. For example, you can pass `posts` to use `?relation=posts` in the URL instead of a numeric array index:

```php
public static function getRelations(): array
{
    return [
        'posts' => RelationManagers\PostsRelationManager::class,
    ];
}
```

### Read-only mode

Relation managers are usually displayed on either the Edit or View page of a resource. On the View page, Filament will automatically hide all actions that modify the relationship, such as create, edit, and delete. We call this "read-only mode", and it is there by default to preserve the read-only behavior of the View page. However, you can disable this behavior, by overriding the `isReadOnly()` method on the relation manager class to return `false` all the time:

```php
public function isReadOnly(): bool
{
    return false;
}
```

Alternatively, if you hate this functionality, you can disable it for all relation managers at once in the panel [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->readOnlyRelationManagersOnResourceViewPagesByDefault(false);
}
```

### Unconventional inverse relationship names

For inverse relationships that do not follow Laravel's naming guidelines, you may wish to use the `inverseRelationship()` method on the table:

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('title'),
            // ...
        ])
        ->inverseRelationship('section'); // Since the inverse related model is `Category`, this is normally `category`, not `section`.
}
```

### Handling soft-deletes

By default, you will not be able to interact with deleted records in the relation manager. If you'd like to add functionality to restore, force-delete and filter trashed records in your relation manager, use the `--soft-deletes` flag when generating the relation manager:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title --soft-deletes
```

You can find out more about soft-deleting [here](#deleting-records).

## Listing related records

Related records will be listed in a table. The entire relation manager is based around this table, which contains actions to [create](#creating-related-records), [edit](#editing-related-records), [attach / detach](#attaching-and-detaching-records), [associate / dissociate](#associating-and-dissociating-records), and delete records.

You may use any features of the [Table Builder](../tables) to customize relation managers.

### Listing with pivot attributes

For `BelongsToMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships, you may also add pivot table attributes. For example, if you have a `TeamsRelationManager` for your `UserResource`, and you want to add the `role` pivot attribute to the table, you can use:

```php
use Filament\Tables;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('name'),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('role'),
        ]);
}
```

Please ensure that any pivot attributes are listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship.

## Creating related records

### Creating with pivot attributes

For `BelongsToMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships, you may also add pivot table attributes. For example, if you have a `TeamsRelationManager` for your `UserResource`, and you want to add the `role` pivot attribute to the create form, you can use:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')->required(),
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('role')->required(),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Please ensure that any pivot attributes are listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship.

### Customizing the `CreateAction`

To learn how to customize the `CreateAction`, including mutating the form data, changing the notification, and adding lifecycle hooks, please see the [Actions documentation](../actions/create).

## Editing related records

### Editing with pivot attributes

For `BelongsToMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships, you may also edit pivot table attributes. For example, if you have a `TeamsRelationManager` for your `UserResource`, and you want to add the `role` pivot attribute to the edit form, you can use:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')->required(),
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('role')->required(),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Please ensure that any pivot attributes are listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship.

### Customizing the `EditAction`

To learn how to customize the `EditAction`, including mutating the form data, changing the notification, and adding lifecycle hooks, please see the [Actions documentation](../actions/edit).

## Attaching and detaching records

Filament is able to attach and detach records for `BelongsToMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships.

When generating your relation manager, you may pass the `--attach` flag to also add `AttachAction`, `DetachAction` and `DetachBulkAction` to the table:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title --attach
```

Alternatively, if you've already generated your resource, you can just add the actions to the `$table` arrays:

```php
use Filament\Actions\AttachAction;
use Filament\Actions\BulkActionGroup;
use Filament\Actions\DetachAction;
use Filament\Actions\DetachBulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->headerActions([
            // ...
            AttachAction::make(),
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            // ...
            DetachAction::make(),
        ])
        ->toolbarActions([
            BulkActionGroup::make([
                // ...
                DetachBulkAction::make(),
            ]),
        ]);
}
```

### Preloading the attachment modal select options

By default, as you search for a record to attach, options will load from the database via AJAX. If you wish to preload these options when the form is first loaded instead, you can use the `preloadRecordSelect()` method of `AttachAction`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\AttachAction;

AttachAction::make()
    ->preloadRecordSelect()
```

### Attaching with pivot attributes

When you attach record with the `Attach` button, you may wish to define a custom form to add pivot attributes to the relationship:

```php
use Filament\Actions\AttachAction;
use Filament\Forms;

AttachAction::make()
    ->schema(fn (AttachAction $action): array => [
        $action->getRecordSelect(),
        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('role')->required(),
    ])
```

In this example, `$action->getRecordSelect()` returns the select field to pick the record to attach. The `role` text input is then saved to the pivot table's `role` column.

Please ensure that any pivot attributes are listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship.

### Scoping the options to attach

You may want to scope the options available to `AttachAction`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\AttachAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

AttachAction::make()
    ->recordSelectOptionsQuery(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereBelongsTo(auth()->user()))
```

### Searching the options to attach across multiple columns

By default, the options available to `AttachAction` will be searched in the `recordTitleAttribute()` of the table. If you wish to search across multiple columns, you can use the `recordSelectSearchColumns()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\AttachAction;

AttachAction::make()
    ->recordSelectSearchColumns(['title', 'description'])
```

### Attaching multiple records

The `multiple()` method on the `AttachAction` component allows you to select multiple values:

```php
use Filament\Actions\AttachAction;

AttachAction::make()
    ->multiple()
```

### Customizing the select field in the attached modal

You may customize the select field object that is used during attachment by passing a function to the `recordSelect()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\AttachAction;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

AttachAction::make()
    ->recordSelect(
        fn (Select $select) => $select->placeholder('Select a post'),
    )
```

### Handling duplicates

By default, you will not be allowed to attach a record more than once. This is because you must also set up a primary `id` column on the pivot table for this feature to work.

Please ensure that the `id` attribute is listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship.

Finally, add the `allowDuplicates()` method to the table:

```php
public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->allowDuplicates();
}
```

### Improving the performance of detach bulk actions

By default, the `DetachBulkAction` will load all Eloquent records into memory, before looping over them and detaching them one by one.

If you are detaching a large number of records, you may want to use the `chunkSelectedRecords()` method to fetch a smaller number of records at a time. This will reduce the memory usage of your application:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DetachBulkAction;

DetachBulkAction::make()
    ->chunkSelectedRecords(250)
```

Filament loads Eloquent records into memory before detaching them for two reasons:

- To allow individual records in the collection to be authorized with a model policy before detaching (using `authorizeIndividualRecords('delete')`, for example).
- To ensure that model events are run when detaching records, such as the `deleting` and `deleted` events in a model observer.

If you do not require individual record policy authorization and model events, you can use the `fetchSelectedRecords(false)` method, which will not fetch the records into memory before detaching them, and instead will detach them in a single query:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DetachBulkAction;

DetachBulkAction::make()
    ->fetchSelectedRecords(false)
```

## Associating and dissociating records

Filament is able to associate and dissociate records for `HasMany` and `MorphMany` relationships.

When generating your relation manager, you may pass the `--associate` flag to also add `AssociateAction`, `DissociateAction` and `DissociateBulkAction` to the table:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title --associate
```

Alternatively, if you've already generated your resource, you can just add the actions to the `$table` arrays:

```php
use Filament\Actions\AssociateAction;
use Filament\Actions\BulkActionGroup;
use Filament\Actions\DissociateAction;
use Filament\Actions\DissociateBulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->headerActions([
            // ...
            AssociateAction::make(),
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            // ...
            DissociateAction::make(),
        ])
        ->toolbarActions([
            BulkActionGroup::make([
                // ...
                DissociateBulkAction::make(),
            ]),
        ]);
}
```

### Preloading the associate modal select options

By default, as you search for a record to associate, options will load from the database via AJAX. If you wish to preload these options when the form is first loaded instead, you can use the `preloadRecordSelect()` method of `AssociateAction`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\AssociateAction;

AssociateAction::make()
    ->preloadRecordSelect()
```

### Scoping the options to associate

You may want to scope the options available to `AssociateAction`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\AssociateAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

AssociateAction::make()
    ->recordSelectOptionsQuery(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereBelongsTo(auth()->user()))
```

### Searching the options to associate across multiple columns

By default, the options available to `AssociateAction` will be searched in the `recordTitleAttribute()` of the table. If you wish to search across multiple columns, you can use the `recordSelectSearchColumns()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\AssociateAction;

AssociateAction::make()
    ->recordSelectSearchColumns(['title', 'description'])
```

### Associating multiple records

The `multiple()` method on the `AssociateAction` component allows you to select multiple values:

```php
use Filament\Actions\AssociateAction;

AssociateAction::make()
    ->multiple()
```

### Customizing the select field in the associate modal

You may customize the select field object that is used during association by passing a function to the `recordSelect()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\AssociateAction;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

AssociateAction::make()
    ->recordSelect(
        fn (Select $select) => $select->placeholder('Select a post'),
    )
```

### Improving the performance of dissociate bulk actions

By default, the `DissociateBulkAction` will load all Eloquent records into memory, before looping over them and dissociating them one by one.

If you are dissociating a large number of records, you may want to use the `chunkSelectedRecords()` method to fetch a smaller number of records at a time. This will reduce the memory usage of your application:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DissociateBulkAction;

DissociateBulkAction::make()
    ->chunkSelectedRecords(250)
```

Filament loads Eloquent records into memory before dissociating them for two reasons:

- To allow individual records in the collection to be authorized with a model policy before dissociation (using `authorizeIndividualRecords('update')`, for example).
- To ensure that model events are run when dissociating records, such as the `updating` and `updated` events in a model observer.

If you do not require individual record policy authorization and model events, you can use the `fetchSelectedRecords(false)` method, which will not fetch the records into memory before dissociating them, and instead will dissociate them in a single query:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DissociateBulkAction;

DissociateBulkAction::make()
    ->fetchSelectedRecords(false)
```

## Viewing related records

When generating your relation manager, you may pass the `--view` flag to also add a `ViewAction` to the table:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title --view
```

Alternatively, if you've already generated your relation manager, you can just add the `ViewAction` to the `$table->recordActions()` array:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ViewAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            ViewAction::make(),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Deleting related records

By default, you will not be able to interact with deleted records in the relation manager. If you'd like to add functionality to restore, force-delete and filter trashed records in your relation manager, use the `--soft-deletes` flag when generating the relation manager:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title --soft-deletes
```

Alternatively, you may add soft-deleting functionality to an existing relation manager:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
use Filament\Actions\DeleteBulkAction;
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteAction;
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteBulkAction;
use Filament\Actions\RestoreAction;
use Filament\Actions\RestoreBulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TrashedFilter;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletingScope;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->withoutGlobalScopes([
            SoftDeletingScope::class,
        ]))
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filters([
            TrashedFilter::make(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            DeleteAction::make(),
            ForceDeleteAction::make(),
            RestoreAction::make(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->toolbarActions([
            BulkActionGroup::make([
                DeleteBulkAction::make(),
                ForceDeleteBulkAction::make(),
                RestoreBulkAction::make(),
                // ...
            ]),
        ]);
}
```

### Customizing the `DeleteAction`

To learn how to customize the `DeleteAction`, including changing the notification and adding lifecycle hooks, please see the [Actions documentation](../actions/delete).

## Importing related records

The [`ImportAction`](../actions/import) can be added to the header of a relation manager to import records. In this case, you probably want to tell the importer which owner these new records belong to. You can use [import options](../actions/import#using-import-options) to pass through the ID of the owner record:

```php
ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->options(['categoryId' => $this->getOwnerRecord()->getKey()])
```

Now, in the importer class, you can associate the owner in a one-to-many relationship with the imported record:

```php
public function resolveRecord(): ?Product
{
    $product = Product::firstOrNew([
        'sku' => $this->data['sku'],
    ]);
    
    $product->category()->associate($this->options['categoryId']);
    
    return $product;
}
```

Alternatively, you can attach the record in a many-to-many relationship using the `afterSave()` hook of the importer:

```php
protected function afterSave(): void
{
    $this->record->categories()->syncWithoutDetaching([$this->options['categoryId']]);
}
```

## Accessing the relationship's owner record

Relation managers are Livewire components. When they are first loaded, the owner record (the Eloquent record which serves as a parent - the main resource model) is saved into a property. You can read this property using:

```php
$this->getOwnerRecord()
```

However, if you're inside a `static` method like `form()` or `table()`, `$this` isn't accessible. So, you may [use a callback](../forms/overview#field-utility-injection) to access the `$livewire` instance:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationManager;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            Forms\Components\Select::make('store_id')
                ->options(function (RelationManager $livewire): array {
                    return $livewire->getOwnerRecord()->stores()
                        ->pluck('name', 'id')
                        ->toArray();
                }),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

All methods in Filament accept a callback which you can access `$livewire->ownerRecord` in.

## Grouping relation managers

You may choose to group relation managers together into one tab. To do this, you may wrap multiple managers in a `RelationGroup` object, with a label:

```php
use Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationGroup;

public static function getRelations(): array
{
    return [
        // ...
        RelationGroup::make('Contacts', [
            RelationManagers\IndividualsRelationManager::class,
            RelationManagers\OrganizationsRelationManager::class,
        ]),
        // ...
    ];
}
```

## Conditionally showing relation managers

By default, relation managers will be visible if the `viewAny()` method for the related model policy returns `true`.

You may use the `canViewForRecord()` method to determine if the relation manager should be visible for a specific owner record and page:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public static function canViewForRecord(Model $ownerRecord, string $pageClass): bool
{
    return $ownerRecord->status === Status::Draft;
}
```

## Combining the relation manager tabs with the form

On the Edit or View page class, override the `hasCombinedRelationManagerTabsWithContent()` method:

```php
public function hasCombinedRelationManagerTabsWithContent(): bool
{
    return true;
}
```

### Customizing the content tab

On the Edit or View page class, override the `getContentTabComponent()` method, and use any [Tab](../schemas/tabs) customization methods:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;

public function getContentTabComponent(): Tab
{
    return Tab::make('Settings')
        ->icon('heroicon-m-cog');
}
```

### Setting the position of the form tab

By default, the form tab is rendered before the relation tabs. To render it after, you can override the `getContentTabPosition()` method on the Edit or View page class:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Pages\Enums\ContentTabPosition;

public function getContentTabPosition(): ?ContentTabPosition
{
    return ContentTabPosition::After;
}
```

## Customizing relation manager tabs

To customize the tab for a relation manager, override the `getTabComponent()` method, and use any [Tab](../schemas/tabs) customization methods:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public static function getTabComponent(Model $ownerRecord, string $pageClass): Tab
{
    return Tab::make('Blog posts')
        ->badge($ownerRecord->posts()->count())
        ->badgeColor('info')
        ->badgeTooltip('The number of posts in this category')
        ->icon('heroicon-m-document-text');
}
```

If you are using a [relation group](#grouping-relation-managers), you can use the `tab()` method:

```php
use Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationGroup;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

RelationGroup::make('Contacts', [
    // ...
])
    ->tab(fn (Model $ownerRecord): Tab => Tab::make('Blog posts')
        ->badge($ownerRecord->posts()->count())
        ->badgeColor('info')
        ->badgeTooltip('The number of posts in this category')
        ->icon('heroicon-m-document-text'));
```

## Sharing a resource's form and table with a relation manager

You may decide that you want a resource's form and table to be identical to a relation manager's, and subsequently want to reuse the code you previously wrote. This is easy, by calling the `form()` and `table()` methods of the resource from the relation manager:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Blog\Posts\PostResource;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return PostResource::form($schema);
}

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return PostResource::table($table);
}
```

### Hiding a shared form component on the relation manager

If you're sharing a form component from the resource with the relation manager, you may want to hide it on the relation manager. This is especially useful if you want to hide a `Select` field for the owner record in the relation manager, since Filament will handle this for you anyway. To do this, you may use the `hiddenOn()` method, passing the name of the relation manager:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Blog\Posts\PostResource\RelationManagers\CommentsRelationManager;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('post_id')
    ->relationship('post', 'title')
    ->hiddenOn(CommentsRelationManager::class)
```

### Hiding a shared table column on the relation manager

If you're sharing a table column from the resource with the relation manager, you may want to hide it on the relation manager. This is especially useful if you want to hide a column for the owner record in the relation manager, since this is not appropriate when the owner record is already listed above the relation manager. To do this, you may use the `hiddenOn()` method, passing the name of the relation manager:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Blog\Posts\PostResource\RelationManagers\CommentsRelationManager;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('post.title')
    ->hiddenOn(CommentsRelationManager::class)
```

### Hiding a shared table filter on the relation manager

If you're sharing a table filter from the resource with the relation manager, you may want to hide it on the relation manager. This is especially useful if you want to hide a filter for the owner record in the relation manager, since this is not appropriate when the table is already filtered by the owner record. To do this, you may use the `hiddenOn()` method, passing the name of the relation manager:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Blog\Posts\PostResource\RelationManagers\CommentsRelationManager;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('post')
    ->relationship('post', 'title')
    ->hiddenOn(CommentsRelationManager::class)
```

### Overriding shared configuration on the relation manager

Any configuration that you make inside the resource can be overwritten on the relation manager. For example, if you wanted to disable pagination on the relation manager's inherited table but not the resource itself:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Blog\Posts\PostResource;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return PostResource::table($table)
        ->paginated(false);
}
```

It is probably also useful to provide extra configuration on the relation manager if you wanted to add a header action to [create](#creating-related-records), [attach](#attaching-and-detaching-records), or [associate](#associating-and-dissociating-records) records in the relation manager:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Blog\Posts\PostResource;
use Filament\Actions\AttachAction;
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return PostResource::table($table)
        ->headerActions([
            CreateAction::make(),
            AttachAction::make(),
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing the relation manager Eloquent query

You can apply your own query constraints or [model scopes](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#query-scopes) that affect the entire relation manager. To do this, you can pass a function to the `modifyQueryUsing()` method of the table, inside which you can customize the query:

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true))
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing the relation manager title

To set the title of the relation manager, you can use the `$title` property on the relation manager class:

```php
protected static ?string $title = 'Posts';
```

To set the title of the relation manager dynamically, you can override the `getTitle()` method on the relation manager class:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public static function getTitle(Model $ownerRecord, string $pageClass): string
{
    return __('relation-managers.posts.title');
}
```

The title will be reflected in the [heading of the table](../tables/overview#customizing-the-table-header), as well as the relation manager tab if there is more than one. If you want to customize the table heading independently, you can still use the `$table->heading()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->heading('Posts')
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing the relation manager record title

The relation manager uses the concept of a "record title attribute" to determine which attribute of the related model should be used to identify it. When creating a relation manager, this attribute is passed as the third argument to the `make:filament-relation-manager` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title
```

In this example, the `title` attribute of the `Post` model will be used to identify a post in the relation manager.

This is mainly used by the action classes. For instance, when you [attach](#attaching-and-detaching-records) or [associate](#associating-and-dissociating-records) a record, the titles will be listed in the select field. When you [edit](#editing-related-records), [view](#viewing-related-records) or [delete](#deleting-related-records) a record, the title will be used in the header of the modal.

In some cases, you may want to concatenate multiple attributes together to form a title. You can do this by replacing the `recordTitleAttribute()` configuration method with `recordTitle()`, passing a function that transforms a model into a title:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->recordTitle(fn (Post $record): string => "{$record->title} ({$record->id})")
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

If you're using `recordTitle()`, and you have an [associate action](#associating-and-dissociating-records) or [attach action](#attaching-and-detaching-records), you will also want to specify search columns for those actions:

```php
use Filament\Actions\AssociateAction;
use Filament\Actions\AttachAction;

AssociateAction::make()
    ->recordSelectSearchColumns(['title', 'id']);

AttachAction::make()
    ->recordSelectSearchColumns(['title', 'id'])
```

## Relation pages

Using a `ManageRelatedRecords` page is an alternative to using a relation manager, if you want to keep the functionality of managing a relationship separate from editing or viewing the owner record.

This feature is ideal if you are using [resource sub-navigation](overview#resource-sub-navigation), as you are easily able to switch between the View or Edit page and the relation page.

To create a relation page, you should use the `make:filament-page` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-page ManageCustomerAddresses --resource=CustomerResource --type=ManageRelatedRecords
```

When you run this command, you will be asked a series of questions to customize the page, for example, the name of the relationship and its title attribute.

You must register this new page in your resource's `getPages()` method:

```php
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        'index' => Pages\ListCustomers::route('/'),
        'create' => Pages\CreateCustomer::route('/create'),
        'view' => Pages\ViewCustomer::route('/{record}'),
        'edit' => Pages\EditCustomer::route('/{record}/edit'),
        'addresses' => Pages\ManageCustomerAddresses::route('/{record}/addresses'),
    ];
}
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    When using a relation page, you do not need to generate a relation manager with `make:filament-relation-manager`, and you do not need to register it in the `getRelations()` method of the resource.
</Aside>

Now, you can customize the page in exactly the same way as a relation manager, with the same `table()` and `form()`.

### Adding relation pages to resource sub-navigation

If you're using [resource sub-navigation](overview#resource-sub-navigation), you can register this page as normal in `getRecordSubNavigation()` of the resource:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Pages;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\Page;

public static function getRecordSubNavigation(Page $page): array
{
    return $page->generateNavigationItems([
        // ...
        Pages\ManageCustomerAddresses::class,
    ]);
}
```

## Passing properties to relation managers

When registering a relation manager in a resource, you can use the `make()` method to pass an array of [Livewire properties](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/properties) to it:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Blog\Posts\PostResource\RelationManagers\CommentsRelationManager;

public static function getRelations(): array
{
    return [
        CommentsRelationManager::make([
            'status' => 'approved',
        ]),
    ];
}
```

This array of properties gets mapped to [public Livewire properties](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/properties) on the relation manager class:

```php
use Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationManager;

class CommentsRelationManager extends RelationManager
{
    public string $status;

    // ...
}
```

Now, you can access the `status` in the relation manager class using `$this->status`.

## Disabling lazy loading

By default, relation managers are lazy-loaded. This means that they will only be loaded when they are visible on the page.

To disable this behavior, you may override the `$isLazy` property on the relation manager class:

```php
protected static bool $isLazy = false;
```

title: Nested resources
---

## Overview

[Relation managers](managing-relationships#creating-a-relation-manager) and [relation pages](managing-relationships#relation-pages) provide you with an easy way to render a table of related records inside a resource.

For example, in a `CourseResource`, you may have a relation manager or page for `lessons` that belong to that course. You can create and edit lessons from the table, which opens modal dialogs.

However, lessons may be too complex to be created and edited in a modal. You may wish that lessons had their own resource, so that creating and editing them would be a full page experience. This is a nested resource.

## Creating a nested resource

To create a nested resource, you can use the `make:filament-resource` command with the `--nested` option:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Lesson --nested
```

To access the nested resource, you will also need a [relation manager](managing-relationships#creating-a-relation-manager) or [relation page](managing-relationships#relation-pages). This is where the user can see the list of related records, and click links to the "create" and "edit" pages.

To create a relation manager or page, you can use the `make:filament-relation-manager` or `make:filament-page` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CourseResource lessons title

php artisan make:filament-page ManageCourseLessons --resource=CourseResource --type=ManageRelatedRecords
```

When creating a relation manager or page, Filament will ask if you want each table row to link to a resource instead of opening a modal, to which you should answer "yes" and select the nested resource that you just created.

After generating the relation manager or page, it will have a property pointing to the nested resource:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Courses\Resources\Lessons\LessonResource;

protected static ?string $relatedResource = LessonResource::class;
```

The nested resource class will have a property pointing to the parent resource:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Courses\CourseResource;

protected static ?string $parentResource = CourseResource::class;
```

## Customizing the relationship names

In the same way that relation managers and pages predict the name of relationships based on the models in those relationships, nested resources do the same. Sometimes, you may have a relationship that does not fit the traditional relationship naming convention, and you will need to inform Filament of the correct relationship names for the nested resource.

To customize the relationship names, first remove the `$parentResource` property from the nested resource class. Then define a `getParentResourceRegistration()` method:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Courses\CourseResource;
use Filament\Resources\ParentResourceRegistration;

public static function getParentResourceRegistration(): ?ParentResourceRegistration
{
    return CourseResource::asParent()
        ->relationship('lessons')
        ->inverseRelationship('course');
}
```

You can omit the calls to `relationship()` and `inverseRelationship()` if you want to use the default names.

## Registering a relation manager with the correct URL

When dealing with a nested resource that is listed by a relation manager, and the relation manager is amongst others on that page, you may notice that the URL to it is not correct when you redirect from the nested resource back to it. This is because each relation manager registered on a resource is assigned an integer, which is used to identify it in the URL when switching between multiple relation managers. For example, `?relation=0` might represent one relation manager in the URL, and `?relation=1` might represent another.

When redirecting from a nested resource back to a relation manager, Filament will assume that the relationship name is used to identify that relation manager in the URL. For example, if you have a nested `LessonResource` and a `LessonsRelationManager`, the relationship name is `lessons`, and should be used as the [URL parameter key](managing-relationships#customizing-the-relation-managers-url-parameter) for that relation manager when it is registered:

```php
public static function getRelations(): array
{
    return [
        'lessons' => LessonsRelationManager::class,
    ];
}
```

title: Singular resources
---

## Overview

Resources aren't the only way to interact with Eloquent records in a Filament panel. Even though resources may solve many of your requirements, the "index" (root) page of a resource contains a table with a list of records in that resource.

Sometimes there is no need for a table that lists records in a resource. There is only a single record that the user interacts with. If it doesn't yet exist when the user visits the page, it gets created when the form is first submitted by the user to save it. If the record already exists, it is loaded into the form when the page is first loaded, and updated when the form is submitted.

For example, a CMS might have a `Page` Eloquent model and a `PageResource`, but you may also want to create a singular page outside the `PageResource` for editing the "homepage" of the website. This allows the user to directly edit the homepage without having to navigate to the `PageResource` and find the homepage record in the table.

Other examples of this include a "Settings" page, or a "Profile" page for the currently logged-in user. For these use cases, though, we recommend that you use the [Spatie Settings plugin](/plugins/filament-spatie-settings) and the [Profile](../users#authentication-features) features of Filament, which require less code to implement.

## Creating a singular resource

Although there is no specific "singular resource" feature in Filament, it is a highly-requested behavior and can be implemented quite simply using a [custom page](../navigation/custom-pages) with a [form](../forms). This guide will explain how to do this.

Firstly, create a [custom page](../navigation/custom-pages):

```bash
php artisan make:filament-page ManageHomepage
```

This command will create two files - a page class in the `/Filament/Pages` directory of your resource directory, and a Blade view in the `/filament/pages` directory of the resource views directory.

The page class should contain the following elements:
- A `$data` property, which will hold the current state of the form.
- A `mount()` method, which will load the current record from the database and fill the form with its data. If the record doesn't exist, `null` will be passed to the `fill()` method of the form, which will assign any default values to the form fields.
- A `form()` method, which will define the form schema. The form contains fields in the `components()` method. The `record()` method should be used to specify the record that the form should load relationship data from. The `statePath()` method should be used to specify the name of the property (`$data`) where the form's state should be stored.
- A `save()` method, which will save the form data to the database. The `getState()` method runs form validation and returns valid form data. This method should check if the record already exists, and if not, create a new one. The `wasRecentlyCreated` property of the model can be used to determine if the record was just created, and if so then any relationships should be saved as well. A notification is sent to the user to confirm that the record was saved.
- A `getRecord()` method, while not strictly necessary, is a good idea to have. This method will return the Eloquent record that the form is editing. It can be used across the other methods to avoid code duplication.

```php
namespace App\Filament\Pages;

use App\Models\WebsitePage;
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Filament\Pages\Page;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

/**
 * @property-read Schema $form
 */
class ManageHomepage extends Page
{
    /**
     * @var array<string, mixed> | null
     */
    public ?array $data = [];

    public function mount(): void
    {
        $this->form->fill($this->getRecord()?->attributesToArray());
    }

    public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
    {
        return $schema
            ->components([
                TextInput::make('title')
                    ->required()
                    ->maxLength(255),
                RichEditor::make('content'),
                // ...
            ])
            ->record($this->getRecord())
            ->statePath('data');
    }

    public function save(): void
    {
        $data = $this->form->getState();
        
        $record = $this->getRecord();
        
        if (! $record) {
            $record = new WebsitePage();
            $record->is_homepage = true;
        }
        
        $record->fill($data);
        $record->save();
        
        if ($record->wasRecentlyCreated) {
            $this->form->record($record)->saveRelationships();
        }

        Notification::make()
            ->success()
            ->title('Saved')
            ->send();
    }
    
    public function getRecord(): ?WebsitePage
    {
        return WebsitePage::query()
            ->where('is_homepage', true)
            ->first();
    }
}
```

The page Blade view should render the form and a Save button. The `wire:submit` directive should be used to call the `save()` method when the form is submitted:

```blade
<x-filament::page>
    <form wire:submit="save">
        {{ $this->form }}
    
        <div>
            <x-filament::button type="submit">
                Save
            </x-filament::button>
        </div>
    </form>
</x-filament::page>
```

title: Global search
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

## Introduction

Global search allows you to search across all of your resource records, from anywhere in the app.

## Setting global search result titles

To enable global search on your model, you must [set a title attribute](overview#record-titles) for your resource:

```php
protected static ?string $recordTitleAttribute = 'title';
```

This attribute is used to retrieve the search result title for that record.

<Aside variant="warning">
    Your resource needs to have an Edit or View page to allow the global search results to link to a URL, otherwise no results will be returned for this resource.
</Aside>

You may customize the title further by overriding `getGlobalSearchResultTitle()` method. It may return a plain text string, or an instance of `Illuminate\Support\HtmlString` or `Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable`. This allows you to render HTML, or even Markdown, in the search result title:

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable;

public static function getGlobalSearchResultTitle(Model $record): string | Htmlable
{
    return $record->name;
}
```

## Globally searching across multiple columns

If you would like to search across multiple columns of your resource, you may override the `getGloballySearchableAttributes()` method. "Dot notation" allows you to search inside relationships:

```php
public static function getGloballySearchableAttributes(): array
{
    return ['title', 'slug', 'author.name', 'category.name'];
}
```

## Adding extra details to global search results

Search results can display "details" below their title, which gives the user more information about the record. To enable this feature, you must override the `getGlobalSearchResultDetails()` method:

```php
public static function getGlobalSearchResultDetails(Model $record): array
{
    return [
        'Author' => $record->author->name,
        'Category' => $record->category->name,
    ];
}
```

In this example, the category and author of the record will be displayed below its title in the search result. However, the `category` and `author` relationships will be lazy-loaded, which will result in poor results performance. To [eager-load](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#eager-loading) these relationships, we must override the `getGlobalSearchEloquentQuery()` method:

```php
public static function getGlobalSearchEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    return parent::getGlobalSearchEloquentQuery()->with(['author', 'category']);
}
```

## Customizing global search result URLs

Global search results will link to the [Edit page](editing-records) of your resource, or the [View page](viewing-page) if the user does not have [edit permissions](editing-records#authorization). To customize this, you may override the `getGlobalSearchResultUrl()` method and return a route of your choice:

```php
public static function getGlobalSearchResultUrl(Model $record): string
{
    return UserResource::getUrl('edit', ['record' => $record]);
}
```

## Adding actions to global search results

Global search supports actions, which are buttons that render below each search result. They can open a URL or dispatch a Livewire event.

Actions can be defined as follows:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

public static function getGlobalSearchResultActions(Model $record): array
{
    return [
        Action::make('edit')
            ->url(static::getUrl('edit', ['record' => $record])),
    ];
}
```

You can learn more about how to style action buttons [here](../actions/overview).

### Opening URLs from global search actions

You can open a URL, optionally in a new tab, when clicking on an action:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('view')
    ->url(static::getUrl('view', ['record' => $record]), shouldOpenInNewTab: true)
```

### Dispatching Livewire events from global search actions

Sometimes you want to execute additional code when a global search result action is clicked. This can be achieved by setting a Livewire event which should be dispatched on clicking the action. You may optionally pass an array of data, which will be available as parameters in the event listener on your Livewire component:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('quickView')
    ->dispatch('quickView', [$record->id])
```

## Limiting the number of global search results

By default, global search will return up to 50 results per resource. You can customize this on the resource label by overriding the `$globalSearchResultsLimit` property:

```php
protected static int $globalSearchResultsLimit = 20;
```

## Disabling global search

As [explained above](#title), global search is automatically enabled once you set a title attribute for your resource. Sometimes you may want to specify the title attribute while not enabling global search.

This can be achieved by disabling global search in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->globalSearch(false);
}
```

## Registering global search key bindings

The global search field can be opened using keyboard shortcuts. To configure these, pass the `globalSearchKeyBindings()` method to the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->globalSearchKeyBindings(['command+k', 'ctrl+k']);
}
```

## Configuring the global search debounce

Global search has a default debounce time of 500ms, to limit the number of requests that are made while the user is typing. You can alter this by using the `globalSearchDebounce()` method in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->globalSearchDebounce('750ms');
}
```

## Configuring the global search field suffix

Global search field by default doesn't include any suffix. You may customize it using the `globalSearchFieldSuffix()` method in the [configuration](../panel-configuration).

If you want to display the currently configured [global search key bindings](#registering-global-search-key-bindings) in the suffix, you can use the `globalSearchFieldKeyBindingSuffix()` method, which will display the first registered key binding as the suffix of the global search field:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->globalSearchFieldKeyBindingSuffix();
}
```

To customize the suffix yourself, you can pass a string or function to the `globalSearchFieldSuffix()` method. For example, to provide a custom key binding suffix for each platform manually:

```php
use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Platform;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->globalSearchFieldSuffix(fn (): ?string => match (Platform::detect()) {
            Platform::Windows, Platform::Linux => 'CTRL+K',
            Platform::Mac => '⌘K',
            default => null,
        });
}
```

## Disabling search term splitting

By default, the global search will split the search term into individual words and search for each word separately. This allows for more flexible search queries. However, it can have a negative impact on performance when large datasets are involved. You can disable this behavior by setting the `$shouldSplitGlobalSearchTerms` property to `false` on the resource:

```php
protected static ?bool $shouldSplitGlobalSearchTerms = false;
```

title: Using widgets on resource pages
---

## Introduction

Filament allows you to display widgets inside pages, below the header and above the footer.

You can use an existing [dashboard widget](../widgets), or create one specifically for the resource.

## Creating a resource widget

To get started building a resource widget:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-widget CustomerOverview --resource=CustomerResource
```

This command will create two files - a widget class in the `app/Filament/Resources/Customers/Widgets` directory, and a view in the `resources/views/filament/resources/customers/widgets` directory.

You must register the new widget in your resource's `getWidgets()` method:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Widgets\CustomerOverview;

public static function getWidgets(): array
{
    return [
        CustomerOverview::class,
    ];
}
```

If you'd like to learn how to build and customize widgets, check out the [Dashboard](../widgets) documentation section.

## Displaying a widget on a resource page

To display a widget on a resource page, use the `getHeaderWidgets()` or `getFooterWidgets()` methods for that page:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Pages;

use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\CustomerResource;

class ListCustomers extends ListRecords
{
    public static string $resource = CustomerResource::class;

    protected function getHeaderWidgets(): array
    {
        return [
            CustomerResource\Widgets\CustomerOverview::class,
        ];
    }
}
```

`getHeaderWidgets()` returns an array of widgets to display above the page content, whereas `getFooterWidgets()` are displayed below.

If you'd like to customize the number of grid columns used to arrange widgets, check out the [Pages documentation](../navigation/custom-pages#customizing-the-widgets-grid).

## Accessing the current record in the widget

If you're using a widget on an [Edit](editing-records) or [View](viewing-records) page, you may access the current record by defining a `$record` property on the widget class:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public ?Model $record = null;
```

## Accessing page table data in the widget

If you're using a widget on a [List](listing-records) page, you may access the table data by first adding the `ExposesTableToWidgets` trait to the page class:

```php
use Filament\Pages\Concerns\ExposesTableToWidgets;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\ListRecords;

class ListProducts extends ListRecords
{
    use ExposesTableToWidgets;

    // ...
}
```

Now, on the widget class, you must add the `InteractsWithPageTable` trait, and return the name of the page class from the `getTablePage()` method:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Products\Pages\ListProducts;
use Filament\Widgets\Concerns\InteractsWithPageTable;
use Filament\Widgets\Widget;

class ProductStats extends Widget
{
    use InteractsWithPageTable;

    protected function getTablePage(): string
    {
        return ListProducts::class;
    }

    // ...
}
```

In the widget class, you can now access the Eloquent query builder instance for the table data using the `$this->getPageTableQuery()` method:

```php
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

Stat::make('Total Products', $this->getPageTableQuery()->count()),
```

Alternatively, you can access a collection of the records on the current page using the `$this->getPageTableRecords()` method:

```php
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

Stat::make('Total Products', $this->getPageTableRecords()->count()),
```

## Passing properties to widgets on resource pages

When registering a widget on a resource page, you can use the `make()` method to pass an array of [Livewire properties](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/properties) to it:

```php
protected function getHeaderWidgets(): array
{
    return [
        CustomerResource\Widgets\CustomerOverview::make([
            'status' => 'active',
        ]),
    ];
}
```

This array of properties gets mapped to [public Livewire properties](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/properties) on the widget class:

```php
use Filament\Widgets\Widget;

class CustomerOverview extends Widget
{
    public string $status;

    // ...
}
```

Now, you can access the `status` in the widget class using `$this->status`.

title: Custom resource pages

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

## Introduction

Filament allows you to create completely custom pages for resources. To create a new page, you can use:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-page SortUsers --resource=UserResource --type=custom
```

This command will create two files - a page class in the `/Pages` directory of your resource directory, and a view in the `/pages` directory of the resource views directory.

You must register custom pages to a route in the static `getPages()` method of your resource:

```php
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        // ...
        'sort' => Pages\SortUsers::route('/sort'),
    ];
}
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    The order of pages registered in this method matters - any wildcard route segments that are defined before hard-coded ones will be matched by Laravel's router first.
</Aside>

Any [parameters](https://laravel.com/docs/routing#route-parameters) defined in the route's path will be available to the page class, in an identical way to [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/components#accessing-route-parameters).

## Using a resource record

If you'd like to create a page that uses a record similar to the [Edit](editing-records) or [View](viewing-records) pages, you can use the `InteractsWithRecord` trait:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Pages\Page;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\Concerns\InteractsWithRecord;

class ManageUser extends Page
{
    use InteractsWithRecord;
    
    public function mount(int | string $record): void
    {
        $this->record = $this->resolveRecord($record);
    }

    // ...
}
```

The `mount()` method should resolve the record from the URL and store it in `$this->record`. You can access the record at any time using `$this->getRecord()` in the class or view.

To add the record to the route as a parameter, you must define `{record}` in `getPages()`:

```php
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        // ...
        'manage' => Pages\ManageUser::route('/{record}/manage'),
    ];
}
```

title: Code quality tips
---

## Using schema and table classes

Since many Filament methods define both the UI and the functionality of the app in just one method, it can be easy to end up with giant methods and files. These can be difficult to read, even if your code has a clean and consistent style.

Filament tries to mitigate some of this by providing dedicated schema and table classes when you generate a resource. These classes have a `configure()` method that accepts a `$schema` or `$table`. You can then call the `configure()` method from anywhere you want to define a schema or table.

For example, if you have the following `app/Filament/Resources/Customers/Schemas/CustomerForm.php` file:

```php
namespace App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Schemas;

use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

class CustomerForm
{
    public static function configure(Schema $schema): Schema
    {
        return $schema
            ->components([
                TextInput::make('name'),
                // ...
            ]);
    }
}
```

You can use this in the `form()` method of the resource:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Schemas\CustomerForm;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public static function form(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return CustomerForm::configure($schema);
}
```

You could do the same for the `table()`:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Schemas\CustomersTable;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return CustomersTable::configure($table);
}
```

Or the `infolist()`:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Schemas\CustomerInfolist;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public static function infolist(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return CustomerInfolist::configure($schema);
}
```

These schema and table classes deliberately don't have a parent class or interface by default. If Filament were to enforce a method signature for the `configure()` method, you would not be able to pass your own configuration variables to the method, which could be useful if you wanted to reuse the same class in multiple places but with slight tweaks.

## Using component classes

Even if you are using [schema and table classes](#using-schema-and-table-classes) to keep the schema and table definitions in their own files, you can still end up with a very long `configure()` method. This is especially true if you are using a lot of components in your schema or table, or if the components require a lot of configuration.

You can mitigate this by creating dedicated classes for each component. For example, if you have a `TextInput` component that requires a lot of configuration, you can create a dedicated class for it:

```php
namespace App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Schemas\Components;

use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

class CustomerNameInput
{
    public static function make(): TextInput
    {
        return TextInput::make('name')
            ->label('Full name')
            ->required()
            ->maxLength(255)
            ->placeholder('Enter your full name')
            ->belowContent('This is the name that will be displayed on your profile.');
    }
}
```

You can then use this class in your schema or table:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Schemas\Components\CustomerNameInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public static function configure(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            CustomerNameInput::make(),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

You could do this with a number of different types of component. There are no enforced rules as to how these components should be named or where they should be stored. However, here are some ideas:

- **Schema components**: These could live in the `Schemas/Components` directory of the resource. They could be named after the component they are wrapping, for example `CustomerNameInput` or `CustomerCountrySelect`.
- **Table columns**: These could live in the `Tables/Columns` directory of the resource. They could be named after the column followed by `Column`, for example `CustomerNameColumn` or `CustomerCountryColumn`.
- **Table filters**: These could live in the `Tables/Filters` directory of the resource. They could be named after the filter followed by `Filter`, for example `CustomerCountryFilter` or `CustomerStatusFilter`.
- **Actions**: These could live in the `Actions` directory of the resource. They could be named after the action followed by `Action` or `BulkAction`, for example `EmailCustomerAction` or `UpdateCustomerCountryBulkAction`.

As a further example, here is a potential `EmailCustomerAction` class:

```php
namespace App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Actions;

use App\Models\Customer;
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

class EmailCustomerAction
{
    public static function make(): Action
    {
        return Action::make('email')
            ->label('Send email')
            ->icon(Heroicon::Envelope)
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('subject')
                    ->required()
                    ->maxLength(255),
                Textarea::make('body')
                    ->autosize()
                    ->required(),
            ])
            ->action(function (Customer $customer, array $data) {
                // ...
            });
    }
}
```

And you could use it in the `getHeaderActions()` of a page:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Actions\EmailCustomerAction;

protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        EmailCustomerAction::make(),
    ];
}
```

Or you could use it on a table row:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Customers\Actions\EmailCustomerAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function configure(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            EmailCustomerAction::make(),
        ]);
}
```

title: Panel configuration
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

## Introduction

By default, the configuration file is located at `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php`. Keep reading to learn more about [panels](#introducing-panels) and how each has [its own configuration file](#creating-a-new-panel).

## Introducing panels

By default, when you install the package, there is one panel that has been set up for you - and it lives on `/admin`. All the [resources](resources), [custom pages](navigation/custom-pages), and [dashboard widgets](dashboard) you create get registered to this panel.

However, you can create as many panels as you want, and each can have its own set of resources, pages and widgets.

For example, you could build a panel where users can log in at `/app` and access their dashboard, and admins can log in at `/admin` and manage the app. The `/app` panel and the `/admin` panel have their own resources, since each group of users has different requirements. Filament allows you to do that by providing you with the ability to create multiple panels.

### The default admin panel

When you run `filament:install`, a new file is created in `app/Providers/Filament` - `AdminPanelProvider.php`. This file contains the configuration for the `/admin` panel.

When this documentation refers to the "configuration", this is the file you need to edit. It allows you to completely customize the app.

### Creating a new panel

To create a new panel, you can use the `make:filament-panel` command, passing in the unique name of the new panel:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-panel app
```

This command will create a new panel called "app". A configuration file will be created at `app/Providers/Filament/AppPanelProvider.php`. You can access this panel at `/app`, but you can [customize the path](#changing-the-path) if you don't want that.

Since this configuration file is also a [Laravel service provider](https://laravel.com/docs/providers), it needs to be registered in `bootstrap/providers.php` (Laravel 11 and above) or `config/app.php` (Laravel 10 and below). Filament will attempt to do this for you, but if you get an error while trying to access your panel then this process has probably failed.

## Changing the path

In a panel configuration file, you can change the path that the app is accessible at using the `path()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->path('app');
}
```

If you want the app to be accessible without any prefix, you can set this to be an empty string:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->path('');
}
```

Make sure your `routes/web.php` file doesn't already define the `''` or `'/'` route, as it will take precedence.

## Render hooks

[Render hooks](advanced/render-hooks) allow you to render Blade content at various points in the framework views. You can [register global render hooks](advanced/render-hooks#registering-render-hooks) in a service provider or middleware, but it also allows you to register render hooks that are specific to a panel. To do that, you can use the `renderHook()` method on the panel configuration object. Here's an example, integrating [`wire-elements/modal`](https://github.com/wire-elements/modal) with Filament:

```php
use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Blade;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->renderHook(
            PanelsRenderHook::BODY_START,
            fn (): string => Blade::render('@livewire(\'livewire-ui-modal\')'),
        );
}
```

A full list of available render hooks can be found [here](advanced/render-hooks#available-render-hooks).

## Setting a domain

By default, Filament will respond to requests from all domains. If you'd like to scope it to a specific domain, you can use the `domain()` method, similar to [`Route::domain()` in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/routing#route-group-subdomain-routing):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->domain('admin.example.com');
}
```

## Customizing the maximum content width

By default, Filament will restrict the width of the content on the page, so it doesn't become too wide on large screens. To change this, you may use the `maxContentWidth()` method. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `ExtraSmall`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `ExtraLarge`, `TwoExtraLarge`, `ThreeExtraLarge`, `FourExtraLarge`, `FiveExtraLarge`, `SixExtraLarge`, `SevenExtraLarge`, `Full`, `MinContent`, `MaxContent`, `FitContent`,  `Prose`, `ScreenSmall`, `ScreenMedium`, `ScreenLarge`, `ScreenExtraLarge` and `ScreenTwoExtraLarge`. The default is `SevenExtraLarge`:

```php
use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Width;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->maxContentWidth(Width::Full);
}
```

If you'd like to set the max content width for pages of the type `SimplePage`, like login and registration pages, you may do so using the `simplePageMaxContentWidth()` method. The default is `Large`:

```php
use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Width;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->simplePageMaxContentWidth(Width::Small);
}
```

## Setting the default sub-navigation position

Sub-navigation is rendered at the start of each page by default. It can be customized per-page, per-resource and per-cluster, but you can also customize it for the entire panel at once using the `subNavigationPosition()` method. The value may be `SubNavigationPosition::Start`, `SubNavigationPosition::End`, or `SubNavigationPosition::Top` to render the sub-navigation as tabs:

```php
use Filament\Pages\Enums\SubNavigationPosition;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->subNavigationPosition(SubNavigationPosition::End);
}
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code during a panel's lifecycle. `bootUsing()` is a hook that gets run on every request that takes place within that panel. If you have multiple panels, only the current panel's `bootUsing()` will be run. The function gets run from middleware, after all service providers have been booted:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->bootUsing(function (Panel $panel) {
            // ...
        });
}
```

## SPA mode

SPA mode utilizes [Livewire's `wire:navigate` feature](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/navigate) to make your server-rendered panel feel like a single-page-application, with less delay between page loads and a loading bar for longer requests. To enable SPA mode on a panel, you can use the `spa()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->spa();
}
```

### Disabling SPA navigation for specific URLs

By default, when enabling SPA mode, any URL that lives on the same domain as the current request will be navigated to using Livewire's [`wire:navigate`](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/navigate) feature. If you want to disable this for specific URLs, you can use the `spaUrlExceptions()` method:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Posts\PostResource;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->spa()
        ->spaUrlExceptions(fn (): array => [
            url('/admin'),
            PostResource::getUrl(),
        ]);
}
```

<Aside variant="info">
    In this example, we are using [`getUrl()`](/resources#generating-urls-to-resource-pages) on a resource to get the URL to the resource's index page. This feature requires the panel to already be registered though, and the configuration is too early in the request lifecycle to do that. You can use a function to return the URLs instead, which will be resolved when the panel has been registered.
</Aside>

These URLs need to exactly match the URL that the user is navigating to, including the domain and protocol. If you'd like to use a pattern to match multiple URLs, you can use an asterisk (`*`) as a wildcard character:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->spa()
        ->spaUrlExceptions([
            '*/admin/posts/*',
        ]);
}
```

### Enabling SPA prefetching

SPA prefetching enhances the user experience by automatically prefetching pages when users hover over links, making navigation feel even more responsive. This feature utilizes [Livewire's `wire:navigate.hover` functionality](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/navigate#prefetching-links).

To enable SPA mode with prefetching, you can pass the `hasPrefetching: true` parameter to the `spa()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->spa(hasPrefetching: true);
}
```

When prefetching is enabled, all links within your panel will automatically include `wire:navigate.hover`, which prefetches the page content when users hover over the link. This works seamlessly with [URL exceptions](#disabling-spa-navigation-for-specific-urls) - any URLs excluded from SPA mode will also be excluded from prefetching.

<Aside variant="info">
    Prefetching only works when SPA mode is enabled. If you disable SPA mode, prefetching will also be disabled automatically.
</Aside>

<Aside variant="warning">
    Prefetching heavy pages can lead to increased bandwidth usage and server load, especially if users hover over many links in quick succession. Use this feature judiciously, particularly if your app has pages with large amounts of data or complex queries.
</Aside>

## Unsaved changes alerts

You may alert users if they attempt to navigate away from a page without saving their changes. This is applied on [Create](resources/creating-records) and [Edit](resources/editing-records) pages of a resource, as well as any open action modals. To enable this feature, you can use the `unsavedChangesAlerts()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->unsavedChangesAlerts();
}
```

## Enabling database transactions

By default, Filament does not wrap operations in database transactions, and allows the user to enable this themselves when they have tested to ensure that their operations are safe to be wrapped in a transaction. However, you can enable database transactions at once for all operations by using the `databaseTransactions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->databaseTransactions();
}
```

For any actions you do not want to be wrapped in a transaction, you can use the `databaseTransaction(false)` method:

```php
CreateAction::make()
    ->databaseTransaction(false)
```

And for any pages like [Create resource](resources/creating-records) and [Edit resource](resources/editing-records), you can define the `$hasDatabaseTransactions` property to `false` on the page class:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Pages\CreateRecord;

class CreatePost extends CreateRecord
{
    protected ?bool $hasDatabaseTransactions = false;

    // ...
}
```

### Opting in to database transactions for specific actions and pages

Instead of enabling database transactions everywhere and opting out of them for specific actions and pages, you can opt in to database transactions for specific actions and pages.

For actions, you can use the `databaseTransaction()` method:

```php
CreateAction::make()
    ->databaseTransaction()
```

For pages like [Create resource](resources/creating-records) and [Edit resource](resources/editing-records), you can define the `$hasDatabaseTransactions` property to `true` on the page class:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Pages\CreateRecord;

class CreatePost extends CreateRecord
{
    protected ?bool $hasDatabaseTransactions = true;

    // ...
}
```

## Registering assets for a panel

You can register [assets](../advanced/assets) that will only be loaded on pages within a specific panel, and not in the rest of the app. To do that, pass an array of assets to the `assets()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\Support\Assets\Css;
use Filament\Support\Assets\Js;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->assets([
            Css::make('custom-stylesheet', resource_path('css/custom.css')),
            Js::make('custom-script', resource_path('js/custom.js')),
        ]);
}
```

Before these [assets](../advanced/assets) can be used, you'll need to run `php artisan filament:assets`.

## Applying middleware

You can apply extra middleware to all routes by passing an array of middleware classes to the `middleware()` method in the configuration:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->middleware([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

By default, middleware will be run when the page is first loaded, but not on subsequent Livewire AJAX requests. If you want to run middleware on every request, you can make it persistent by passing `true` as the second argument to the `middleware()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->middleware([
            // ...
        ], isPersistent: true);
}
```

### Applying middleware to authenticated routes

You can apply middleware to all authenticated routes by passing an array of middleware classes to the `authMiddleware()` method in the configuration:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->authMiddleware([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

By default, middleware will be run when the page is first loaded, but not on subsequent Livewire AJAX requests. If you want to run middleware on every request, you can make it persistent by passing `true` as the second argument to the `authMiddleware()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->authMiddleware([
            // ...
        ], isPersistent: true);
}
```

## Disabling broadcasting

By default, Laravel Echo will automatically connect for every panel, if credentials have been set up in the [published `config/filament.php` configuration file](installation#publishing-configuration). To disable this automatic connection in a panel, you can use the `broadcasting(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->broadcasting(false);
}
```

## Strict authorization mode

By default, when Filament authorizes the user access to a resource, it will first check if the policy exists for that model, and if it does, it will check if a method exists on the policy to perform the action. If the policy or policy method does not exist, it will grant the user access to the resource, as it assumes you have not set up authorization yet, or you do not require it.

If you would prefer Filament to throw an exception if the policy or policy method does not exist, you can enable strict authorization mode using the `strictAuthorization()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->strictAuthorization();
}
```

## Configuring error notifications

When Laravel's debug mode is disabled, Filament will replace Livewire's full-screen error modals with neater flash notifications. You can disable this behavior using the `errorNotifications(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->errorNotifications(false);
}
```

You may customize the error notification text by passing strings to the `title` and `body` parameters of the `registerErrorNotification()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->registerErrorNotification(
            title: 'An error occurred',
            body: 'Please try again later.',
        );
}
```

You may also register error notification text for a specific HTTP status code, such as `404`, by passing that status code in the `statusCode` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->registerErrorNotification(
            title: 'An error occurred',
            body: 'Please try again later.',
        )
        ->registerErrorNotification(
            title: 'Record not found',
            body: 'A record you are looking for does not exist.',
            statusCode: 404,
        );
}
```

You can also enable or disable error notifications for specific pages in a panel by setting the `$hasErrorNotifications` property on the page class:

```php
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard as BaseDashboard;

class Dashboard extends BaseDashboard
{
    protected ?bool $hasErrorNotifications = true;
    
    // or
    
    protected ?bool $hasErrorNotifications = false;

    // ...
}
```

If you would like to run custom code to check if error notifications should be shown, you can use the `hasErrorNotifications()` method on the page class:

```php
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard as BaseDashboard;

class Dashboard extends BaseDashboard
{
    public function hasErrorNotifications(): bool
    {
        return FeatureFlag::active();
    }

    // ...
}
```

You may also register error notification text by calling the `registerErrorNotification()` method on the page class from inside the `setUpErrorNotifications()` method:

```php
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard as BaseDashboard;

class Dashboard extends BaseDashboard
{
    protected function setUpErrorNotifications(): void
    {
        $this->registerErrorNotification(
            title: 'An error occurred',
            body: 'Please try again later.',
        );
    }

    // ...
}
```

You can also register error notification text for a specific HTTP status code, such as `404`, by passing that status code in the `statusCode` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard as BaseDashboard;

class Dashboard extends BaseDashboard
{
    protected function setUpErrorNotifications(): void
    {
        $this->registerErrorNotification(
            title: 'An error occurred',
            body: 'Please try again later.',
        );
    
        $this->registerErrorNotification(
            title: 'Record not found',
            body: 'A record you are looking for does not exist.',
            statusCode: 404,
        );
    }

    // ...
}
```

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

## Introduction

By default, Filament will register navigation items for each of your [resources](../resources), [custom pages](custom-pages), and [clusters](clusters). These classes contain static properties and methods that you can override, to configure that navigation item.

If you're looking to add a second layer of navigation to your app, you can use [clusters](clusters). These are useful for grouping resources and pages together.

## Customizing a navigation item's label

By default, the navigation label is generated from the resource or page's name. You may customize this using the `$navigationLabel` property:

```php
protected static ?string $navigationLabel = 'Custom Navigation Label';
```

Alternatively, you may override the `getNavigationLabel()` method:

```php
public static function getNavigationLabel(): string
{
    return 'Custom Navigation Label';
}
```

## Customizing a navigation item's icon

To customize a navigation item's [icon](../styling/icons), you may override the `$navigationIcon` property on the [resource](resources) or [page](pages) class:

```php
use BackedEnum;

protected static string | BackedEnum | null $navigationIcon = 'heroicon-o-document-text';
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/change-icon" alt="Changed navigation item icon" version="3.x" />

If you set `$navigationIcon = null` on all items within the same navigation group, those items will be joined with a vertical bar below the group label.

### Switching navigation item icon when it is active

You may assign a navigation [icon](../styling/icons) which will only be used for active items using the `$activeNavigationIcon` property:

```php
protected static ?string $activeNavigationIcon = 'heroicon-o-document-text';
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/active-icon" alt="Different navigation item icon when active" version="3.x" />

## Sorting navigation items

By default, navigation items are sorted alphabetically. You may customize this using the `$navigationSort` property:

```php
protected static ?int $navigationSort = 3;
```

Now, navigation items with a lower sort value will appear before those with a higher sort value - the order is ascending.

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/sort-items" alt="Sort navigation items" version="3.x" />

## Adding a badge to a navigation item

To add a badge next to the navigation item, you can use the `getNavigationBadge()` method and return the content of the badge:

```php
public static function getNavigationBadge(): ?string
{
    return static::getModel()::count();
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/badge" alt="Navigation item with badge" version="3.x" />

If a badge value is returned by `getNavigationBadge()`, it will display using the primary color by default. To style the badge contextually, return either `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning` from the `getNavigationBadgeColor()` method:

```php
public static function getNavigationBadgeColor(): ?string
{
    return static::getModel()::count() > 10 ? 'warning' : 'primary';
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/badge-color" alt="Navigation item with badge color" version="3.x" />

A custom tooltip for the navigation badge can be set in `$navigationBadgeTooltip`:

```php
protected static ?string $navigationBadgeTooltip = 'The number of users';
```

Or it can be returned from `getNavigationBadgeTooltip()`:

```php
public static function getNavigationBadgeTooltip(): ?string
{
    return 'The number of users';
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/badge-tooltip" alt="Navigation item with badge tooltip" version="3.x" />

## Grouping navigation items

You may group navigation items by specifying a `$navigationGroup` property on a [resource](resources) and [custom page](custom-pages):

```php
use UnitEnum;

protected static string | UnitEnum | null $navigationGroup = 'Settings';
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/group" alt="Grouped navigation items" version="3.x" />

All items in the same navigation group will be displayed together under the same group label, "Settings" in this case. Ungrouped items will remain at the start of the navigation.

### Grouping navigation items under other items

You may group navigation items as children of other items, by passing the label of the parent item as the `$navigationParentItem`:

```php
use UnitEnum;

protected static ?string $navigationParentItem = 'Notifications';

protected static string | UnitEnum | null $navigationGroup = 'Settings';
```

You may also use the `getNavigationParentItem()` method to set a dynamic parent item label:

```php
public static function getNavigationParentItem(): ?string
{
    return __('filament/navigation.groups.settings.items.notifications');
}
```

As seen above, if the parent item has a navigation group, that navigation group must also be defined, so the correct parent item can be identified.

<Aside variant="tip">
    If you're reaching for a third level of navigation like this, you should consider using [clusters](clusters) instead, which are a logical grouping of resources and custom pages, which can share their own separate navigation.
</Aside>

### Customizing navigation groups

You may customize navigation groups by calling `navigationGroups()` in the [configuration](../panel-configuration), and passing `NavigationGroup` objects in order:

```php
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationGroup;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->navigationGroups([
            NavigationGroup::make()
                 ->label('Shop')
                 ->icon('heroicon-o-shopping-cart'),
            NavigationGroup::make()
                ->label('Blog')
                ->icon('heroicon-o-pencil'),
            NavigationGroup::make()
                ->label(fn (): string => __('navigation.settings'))
                ->icon('heroicon-o-cog-6-tooth')
                ->collapsed(),
        ]);
}
```

In this example, we pass in a custom `icon()` for the groups, and make one `collapsed()` by default.

#### Ordering navigation groups

By using `navigationGroups()`, you are defining a new order for the navigation groups. If you just want to reorder the groups and not define an entire `NavigationGroup` object, you may just pass the labels of the groups in the new order:

```php
$panel
    ->navigationGroups([
        'Shop',
        'Blog',
        'Settings',
    ])
```

#### Making navigation groups not collapsible

By default, navigation groups are collapsible.

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/group-collapsible" alt="Collapsible navigation groups" version="3.x" />

You may disable this behavior by calling `collapsible(false)` on the `NavigationGroup` object:

```php
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationGroup;

NavigationGroup::make()
    ->label('Settings')
    ->icon('heroicon-o-cog-6-tooth')
    ->collapsible(false);
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/group-not-collapsible" alt="Not collapsible navigation groups" version="3.x" />

Or, you can do it globally for all groups in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->collapsibleNavigationGroups(false);
}
```

#### Adding extra HTML attributes to navigation groups

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the navigation group, which will be merged onto the outer DOM element. Pass an array of attributes to the `extraSidebarAttributes()` or `extraTopbarAttributes()` method, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value:

```php
NavigationGroup::make()
    ->extraSidebarAttributes(['class' => 'featured-sidebar-group']),
    ->extraTopbarAttributes(['class' => 'featured-topbar-group']),
```

The `extraSidebarAttributes()` will be applied to navigation group elements contained in the sidebar, and the `extraTopbarAttributes()` will only be applied to topbar navigation group dropdowns when using [top navigation](#using-top-navigation).

### Registering navigation groups with an enum

You can use an enum class to register navigation groups, which allows you to control their labels, icons, and order in a single place, without needing to register them in the [configuration](../panel-configuration).

To do this, you can create an enum class with cases for each group:

```php
enum NavigationGroup
{
    case Shop;
    
    case Blog;
    
    case Settings;
}
```

To order that the cases are defined in will control the order of the navigation groups.

To use an enum navigation group for a resource or custom page, you can set the `$navigationGroup` property to the enum case:

```php
protected static string | UnitEnum | null $navigationGroup = NavigationGroup::Shop;
```

You can also implement the `HasLabel` interface on the enum class, to define a custom label for each group:

```php
use Filament\Support\Contracts\HasLabel;

enum NavigationGroup implements HasLabel
{
    case Shop;
    
    case Blog;
    
    case Settings;

    public function getLabel(): string
    {
        return match ($this) {
            self::Shop => __('navigation-groups.shop'),
            self::Blog => __('navigation-groups.blog'),
            self::Settings => __('navigation-groups.settings'),
        };
    }
}
```

You can also implement the `HasIcon` interface on the enum class, to define a custom icon for each group:

```php
use Filament\Support\Contracts\HasIcon;

enum NavigationGroup implements HasIcon
{
    case Shop;
    
    case Blog;
    
    case Settings;

    public function getIcon(): ?string
    {
        return match ($this) {
            self::Shop => 'heroicon-o-shopping-cart',
            self::Blog => 'heroicon-o-pencil',
            self::Settings => 'heroicon-o-cog-6-tooth',
        };
    }
}
```

## Collapsible sidebar on desktop

To make the sidebar collapsible on desktop as well as mobile, you can use the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->sidebarCollapsibleOnDesktop();
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/sidebar-collapsible-on-desktop" alt="Collapsible sidebar on desktop" version="3.x" />

By default, when you collapse the sidebar on desktop, the navigation icons still show. You can fully collapse the sidebar using the `sidebarFullyCollapsibleOnDesktop()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->sidebarFullyCollapsibleOnDesktop();
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/sidebar-fully-collapsible-on-desktop" alt="Fully collapsible sidebar on desktop" version="3.x" />

### Navigation groups in a collapsible sidebar on desktop

<Aside variant="info">
    This section only applies to `sidebarCollapsibleOnDesktop()`, not `sidebarFullyCollapsibleOnDesktop()`, since the fully collapsible UI just hides the entire sidebar instead of changing its design.
</Aside>

When using a collapsible sidebar on desktop, you will also often be using [navigation groups](#grouping-navigation-items). By default, the labels of each navigation group will be hidden when the sidebar is collapsed, since there is no space to display them. Even if the navigation group itself is [collapsible](#making-navigation-groups-not-collapsible), all items will still be visible in the collapsed sidebar, since there is no group label to click on to expand the group.

These issues can be solved, to achieve a very minimal sidebar design, by [passing an `icon()`](#customizing-navigation-groups) to the navigation group objects. When an icon is defined, the icon will be displayed in the collapsed sidebar instead of the items at all times. When the icon is clicked, a dropdown will open to the side of the icon, revealing the items in the group.

When passing an icon to a navigation group, even if the items also have icons, the expanded sidebar UI will not show the item icons. This is to keep the navigation hierarchy clear, and the design minimal. However, the icons for the items will be shown in the collapsed sidebar's dropdowns though, since the hierarchy is already clear from the fact that the dropdown is open.

## Registering custom navigation items

To register new navigation items, you can use the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationItem;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard;
use Filament\Panel;
use function Filament\Support\original_request;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->navigationItems([
            NavigationItem::make('Analytics')
                ->url('https://filament.pirsch.io', shouldOpenInNewTab: true)
                ->icon('heroicon-o-presentation-chart-line')
                ->group('Reports')
                ->sort(3),
            NavigationItem::make('dashboard')
                ->label(fn (): string => __('filament-panels::pages/dashboard.title'))
                ->url(fn (): string => Dashboard::getUrl())
                ->isActiveWhen(fn () => original_request()->routeIs('filament.admin.pages.dashboard')),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Conditionally hiding navigation items

You can also conditionally hide a navigation item by using the `visible()` or `hidden()` methods, passing in a condition to check:

```php
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationItem;

NavigationItem::make('Analytics')
    ->visible(fn(): bool => auth()->user()->can('view-analytics'))
    // or
    ->hidden(fn(): bool => ! auth()->user()->can('view-analytics')),
```

## Disabling resource or page navigation items

To prevent resources or pages from showing up in navigation, you may use:

```php
protected static bool $shouldRegisterNavigation = false;
```

Or, you may override the `shouldRegisterNavigation()` method:

```php
public static function shouldRegisterNavigation(): bool
{
    return false;
}
```

Please note that these methods do not control direct access to the resource or page. They only control whether the resource or page will show up in the navigation. If you want to also control access, then you should use [resource authorization](../resources#authorization) or [page authorization](custom-pages#authorization).

## Using top navigation

By default, Filament will use a sidebar navigation. You may use a top navigation instead by using the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->topNavigation();
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/top-navigation" alt="Top navigation" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the width of the sidebar

You can customize the width of the sidebar by passing it to the `sidebarWidth()` method in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->sidebarWidth('40rem');
}
```

Additionally, if you are using the `sidebarCollapsibleOnDesktop()` method, you can customize width of the collapsed icons by using the `collapsedSidebarWidth()` method in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->sidebarCollapsibleOnDesktop()
        ->collapsedSidebarWidth('9rem');
}
```

## Advanced navigation customization

The `navigation()` method can be called from the [configuration](../panel-configuration). It allows you to build a custom navigation that overrides Filament's automatically generated items. This API is designed to give you complete control over the navigation.

### Registering custom navigation items

To register navigation items, call the `items()` method:

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Settings;
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\UserResource;
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationBuilder;
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationItem;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard;
use Filament\Panel;
use function Filament\Support\original_request;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->navigation(function (NavigationBuilder $builder): NavigationBuilder {
            return $builder->items([
                NavigationItem::make('Dashboard')
                    ->icon('heroicon-o-home')
                    ->isActiveWhen(fn (): bool => original_request()->routeIs('filament.admin.pages.dashboard'))
                    ->url(fn (): string => Dashboard::getUrl()),
                ...UserResource::getNavigationItems(),
                ...Settings::getNavigationItems(),
            ]);
        });
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/custom-items" alt="Custom navigation items" version="3.x" />

### Registering custom navigation groups

If you want to register groups, you can call the `groups()` method:

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\HomePageSettings;
use App\Filament\Resources\Categories\CategoryResource;
use App\Filament\Resources\Pages\PageResource;
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationBuilder;
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationGroup;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->navigation(function (NavigationBuilder $builder): NavigationBuilder {
            return $builder->groups([
                NavigationGroup::make('Website')
                    ->items([
                        ...PageResource::getNavigationItems(),
                        ...CategoryResource::getNavigationItems(),
                        ...HomePageSettings::getNavigationItems(),
                    ]),
            ]);
        });
}
```

### Disabling navigation

You may disable navigation entirely by passing `false` to the `navigation()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->navigation(false);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/disabled-navigation" alt="Disabled navigation sidebar" version="3.x" />

### Disabling the topbar

You may disable topbar entirely by passing `false` to the `topbar()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->topbar(false);
}
```

### Replacing the sidebar and topbar Livewire components

You may completely replace the Livewire components that are used to render the sidebar and topbar, passing your own Livewire component class name into the `sidebarLivewireComponent()` or `topbarLivewireComponent()` method:

```php
use App\Livewire\Sidebar;
use App\Livewire\Topbar;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->sidebarLivewireComponent(Sidebar::class)
        ->topbarLivewireComponent(Topbar::class);
}
```

## Disabling breadcrumbs

The default layout will show breadcrumbs to indicate the location of the current page within the hierarchy of the app.

You may disable breadcrumbs in your [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->breadcrumbs(false);
}
```

## Reloading the sidebar and topbar

Once a page in the panel is loaded, the sidebar and topbar are not reloaded until you navigate away from the page, or until a menu item is clicked to trigger an action. You can manually reload these components to update them by dispatching a `refresh-sidebar` or `refresh-topbar` browser event.

To dispatch an event from PHP, you can call the `$this->dispatch()` method from any Livewire component, such as a page class, relation manager class, or widget class:

```php
$this->dispatch('refresh-sidebar');
```

When your code does not live inside a Livewire component, such as when you have a custom action class, you can inject the `$livewire` argument into a closure function, and call `dispatch()` on that:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Livewire\Component;

Action::make('create')
    ->action(function (Component $livewire) {
        // ...
    
        $livewire->dispatch('refresh-sidebar');
    })
```

Alternatively, you can dispatch an event from JavaScript using the `$dispatch()` Alpine.js helper method, or the native browser `window.dispatchEvent()` method:

```html
<button x-on:click="$dispatch('refresh-sidebar')" type="button">
    Refresh Sidebar
</button>
```

```javascript
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('refresh-sidebar'));
```

title: Custom pages
---

## Introduction

Filament allows you to create completely custom pages for the app.

## Creating a page

To create a new page, you can use:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-page Settings
```

This command will create two files - a page class in the `/Pages` directory of the Filament directory, and a view in the `/pages` directory of the Filament views directory.

Page classes are all full-page [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) components with a few extra utilities you can use with the panel.

## Authorization

You can prevent pages from appearing in the menu by overriding the `canAccess()` method in your Page class. This is useful if you want to control which users can see the page in the navigation, and also which users can visit the page directly:

```php
public static function canAccess(): bool
{
    return auth()->user()->canManageSettings();
}
```

## Adding actions to pages

Actions are buttons that can perform tasks on the page, or visit a URL. You can read more about their capabilities [here](../actions).

Since all pages are Livewire components, you can [add actions](../components/action#adding-the-action) anywhere. Pages already have the `InteractsWithActions` trait, `HasActions` interface, and `<x-filament-actions::modals />` Blade component all set up for you.

### Header actions

You can also easily add actions to the header of any page, including [resource pages](resources). You don't need to worry about adding anything to the Blade template, we handle that for you. Just return your actions from the `getHeaderActions()` method of the page class:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        Action::make('edit')
            ->url(route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post])),
        Action::make('delete')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(fn () => $this->post->delete()),
    ];
}
```

### Opening an action modal when a page loads

You can also open an action when a page loads by setting the `$defaultAction` property to the name of the action you want to open:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

public $defaultAction = 'onboarding';

public function onboardingAction(): Action
{
    return Action::make('onboarding')
        ->modalHeading('Welcome')
        ->visible(fn (): bool => ! auth()->user()->isOnBoarded());
}
```

You can also pass an array of arguments to the default action using the `$defaultActionArguments` property:

```php
public $defaultActionArguments = ['step' => 2];
```

Alternatively, you can open an action modal when a page loads by specifying the `action` as a query string parameter to the page:

```
/admin/products/edit/932510?action=onboarding
```

### Refreshing form data

If you're using actions on an [Edit](resources/editing-records) or [View](resources/viewing-records) resource page, you can refresh data within the main form using the `refreshFormData()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('approve')
    ->action(function (Post $record) {
        $record->approve();

        $this->refreshFormData([
            'status',
        ]);
    })
```

This method accepts an array of model attributes that you wish to refresh in the form.

## Adding widgets to pages

Filament allows you to display [widgets](dashboard) inside pages, below the header and above the footer.

To add a widget to a page, use the `getHeaderWidgets()` or `getFooterWidgets()` methods:

```php
use App\Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget;

protected function getHeaderWidgets(): array
{
    return [
        StatsOverviewWidget::class
    ];
}
```

`getHeaderWidgets()` returns an array of widgets to display above the page content, whereas `getFooterWidgets()` are displayed below.

If you'd like to learn how to build and customize widgets, check out the [Dashboard](dashboard) documentation section.

### Customizing the widgets' grid

You may change how many grid columns are used to display widgets.

You may override the `getHeaderWidgetsColumns()` or `getFooterWidgetsColumns()` methods to return a number of grid columns to use:

```php
public function getHeaderWidgetsColumns(): int | array
{
    return 3;
}
```

#### Responsive widgets grid

You may wish to change the number of widget grid columns based on the responsive [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) of the browser. You can do this using an array that contains the number of columns that should be used at each breakpoint:

```php
public function getHeaderWidgetsColumns(): int | array
{
    return [
        'md' => 4,
        'xl' => 5,
    ];
}
```

This pairs well with [responsive widget widths](dashboard#responsive-widget-widths).

#### Passing data to widgets from the page

You may pass data to widgets from the page using the `getWidgetData()` method:

```php
public function getWidgetData(): array
{
    return [
        'stats' => [
            'total' => 100,
        ],
    ];
}
```

Now, you can define a corresponding public `$stats` array property on the widget class, which will be automatically filled:

```php
public $stats = [];
```

### Passing properties to widgets on pages

When registering a widget on a page, you can use the `make()` method to pass an array of [Livewire properties](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/properties) to it:

```php
use App\Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget;

protected function getHeaderWidgets(): array
{
    return [
        StatsOverviewWidget::make([
            'status' => 'active',
        ]),
    ];
}
```

This array of properties gets mapped to [public Livewire properties](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/properties) on the widget class:

```php
use Filament\Widgets\Widget;

class StatsOverviewWidget extends Widget
{
    public string $status;

    // ...
}
```

Now, you can access the `status` in the widget class using `$this->status`.

## Customizing the page title

By default, Filament will automatically generate a title for your page based on its name. You may override this by defining a `$title` property on your page class:

```php
protected static ?string $title = 'Custom Page Title';
```

Alternatively, you may return a string from the `getTitle()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable;

public function getTitle(): string | Htmlable
{
    return __('Custom Page Title');
}
```

## Customizing the page navigation label

By default, Filament will use the page's [title](#customizing-the-page-title) as its [navigation](navigation) item label. You may override this by defining a `$navigationLabel` property on your page class:

```php
protected static ?string $navigationLabel = 'Custom Navigation Label';
```

Alternatively, you may return a string from the `getNavigationLabel()` method:

```php
public static function getNavigationLabel(): string
{
    return __('Custom Navigation Label');
}
```

## Customizing the page URL

By default, Filament will automatically generate a URL (slug) for your page based on its name. You may override this by defining a `$slug` property on your page class:

```php
protected static ?string $slug = 'custom-url-slug';
```

## Customizing the page heading

By default, Filament will use the page's [title](#customizing-the-page-title) as its heading. You may override this by defining a `$heading` property on your page class:

```php
protected ?string $heading = 'Custom Page Heading';
```

Alternatively, you may return a string from the `getHeading()` method:

```php
public function getHeading(): string
{
    return __('Custom Page Heading');
}
```

### Adding a page subheading

You may also add a subheading to your page by defining a `$subheading` property on your page class:

```php
protected ?string $subheading = 'Custom Page Subheading';
```

Alternatively, you may return a string from the `getSubheading()` method:

```php
public function getSubheading(): ?string
{
    return __('Custom Page Subheading');
}
```

## Replacing the page header with a custom view

You may replace the default [heading](#customizing-the-page-heading), [subheading](#adding-a-page-subheading) and [actions](#header-actions) with a custom header view for any page. You may return it from the `getHeader()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;

public function getHeader(): ?View
{
    return view('filament.settings.custom-header');
}
```

This example assumes you have a Blade view at `resources/views/filament/settings/custom-header.blade.php`.

## Rendering a custom view in the footer of the page

You may also add a footer to any page, below its content. You may return it from the `getFooter()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;

public function getFooter(): ?View
{
    return view('filament.settings.custom-footer');
}
```

This example assumes you have a Blade view at `resources/views/filament/settings/custom-footer.blade.php`.

## Customizing the maximum content width

By default, Filament will restrict the width of the content on the page, so it doesn't become too wide on large screens. To change this, you may override the `getMaxContentWidth()` method. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `ExtraSmall`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `ExtraLarge`, `TwoExtraLarge`, `ThreeExtraLarge`, `FourExtraLarge`, `FiveExtraLarge`, `SixExtraLarge`, `SevenExtraLarge`, `Full`, `MinContent`, `MaxContent`, `FitContent`,  `Prose`, `ScreenSmall`, `ScreenMedium`, `ScreenLarge`, `ScreenExtraLarge` and `ScreenTwoExtraLarge`. The default is `SevenExtraLarge`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\Width;

public function getMaxContentWidth(): Width
{
    return Width::Full;
}
```

## Generating URLs to pages

Filament provides `getUrl()` static method on page classes to generate URLs to them. Traditionally, you would need to construct the URL by hand or by using Laravel's `route()` helper, but these methods depend on knowledge of the page's slug or route naming conventions.

The `getUrl()` method, without any arguments, will generate a URL:

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Settings;

Settings::getUrl(); // /admin/settings
```

If your page uses URL / query parameters, you should use the argument:

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Settings;

Settings::getUrl(['section' => 'notifications']); // /admin/settings?section=notifications
```

### Generating URLs to pages in other panels

If you have multiple panels in your app, `getUrl()` will generate a URL within the current panel. You can also indicate which panel the page is associated with, by passing the panel ID to the `panel` argument:

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Settings;

Settings::getUrl(panel: 'marketing');
```

## Adding sub-navigation between pages

You may want to add a common sub-navigation to multiple pages, to allow users to quickly navigate between them. You can do this by defining a [cluster](clusters). Clusters can also contain [resources](resources), and you can switch between multiple pages or resources within a cluster.

## Setting the sub-navigation position

The sub-navigation is rendered at the start of the page by default. You may change the position for a page by setting the `$subNavigationPosition` property on the page. The value may be `SubNavigationPosition::Start`, `SubNavigationPosition::End`, or `SubNavigationPosition::Top` to render the sub-navigation as tabs:

```php
use Filament\Pages\Enums\SubNavigationPosition;

protected static ?SubNavigationPosition $subNavigationPosition = SubNavigationPosition::End;
```

## Adding extra attributes to the body tag of a page

You may wish to add extra attributes to the `<body>` tag of a page. To do this, you can set an array of attributes in `$extraBodyAttributes`:

```php
protected array $extraBodyAttributes = [];
```

Or, you can return an array of attributes and their values from the `getExtraBodyAttributes()` method:

```php
public function getExtraBodyAttributes(): array
{
    return [
        'class' => 'settings-page',
    ];
}
```

<!-- Source: docs/06-navigation/03-user-menu.md -->

---

---
title: User menu
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Introduction

The user menu is featured in the top right corner of the admin layout. It's fully customizable.

Each menu item is represented by an [action](../actions), and can be customized in the same way. To register new items, you can pass the actions to the `userMenuItems()` method of the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Settings;
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->userMenuItems([
            Action::make('settings')
                ->url(fn (): string => Settings::getUrl())
                ->icon('heroicon-o-cog-6-tooth'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/user-menu" alt="User menu with custom menu item" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the profile link

To customize the user profile link at the start of the user menu, register a new item with the `profile` array key, and pass a function that [customizes the action](../actions) object:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->userMenuItems([
            'profile' => fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Edit profile'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

For more information on creating a profile page, check out the [authentication features documentation](../users#authentication-features).

## Customizing the logout link

To customize the user logout link at the end of the user menu, register a new item with the `logout` array key, and pass a function that [customizes the action](../actions) object:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->userMenuItems([
            'logout' => fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Log out'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Conditionally hiding user menu items

You can also conditionally hide a user menu item by using the `visible()` or `hidden()` methods, passing in a condition to check. Passing a function will defer condition evaluation until the menu is actually being rendered:

```php
use App\Models\Payment;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('payments')
    ->visible(fn (): bool => auth()->user()->can('viewAny', Payment::class))
    // or
    ->hidden(fn (): bool => ! auth()->user()->can('viewAny', Payment::class))
```

## Sending a `POST` HTTP request from a user menu item

You can send a `POST` HTTP request from a user menu item by passing a URL to the `url()` method, and also using `postToUrl()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('lockSession')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('lock-session'))
    ->postToUrl()
```

## Disabling the user menu

You may disable the user menu entirely by passing `false` to the `userMenu()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->userMenu(false);
}
```

<!-- Source: docs/06-navigation/04-clusters.md -->

---

---
title: Clusters
---

## Introduction

Clusters are a hierarchical structure in panels that allow you to group [resources](../resources) and [custom pages](custom-pages) together. They are useful for organizing your panel into logical sections, and can help reduce the size of your panel's sidebar.

When using a cluster, a few things happen:

- A new navigation item is added to the navigation, which is a link to the first resource or page in the cluster.
- The individual navigation items for the resources or pages are no longer visible in the main navigation.
- A new sub-navigation UI is added to each resource or page in the cluster, which contains the navigation items for the resources or pages in the cluster.
- Resources and pages in the cluster get a new URL, prefixed with the name of the cluster. If you are generating URLs to [resources](../resources#generating-urls-to-resource-pages) and [pages](custom-pages#generating-urls-to-pages) correctly, then this change should be handled for you automatically.
- The cluster's name is in the breadcrumbs of all resources and pages in the cluster. When clicking it, you are taken to the first resource or page in the cluster.

## Creating a cluster

Before creating your first cluster, you must tell the panel where cluster classes should be located. Alongside methods like `discoverResources()` and `discoverPages()` in the [configuration](../panel-configuration), you can use `discoverClusters()`:

```php
public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->discoverResources(in: app_path('Filament/Resources'), for: 'App\\Filament\\Resources')
        ->discoverPages(in: app_path('Filament/Pages'), for: 'App\\Filament\\Pages')
        ->discoverClusters(in: app_path('Filament/Clusters'), for: 'App\\Filament\\Clusters');
}
```

Now, you can create a cluster with the `php artisan make:filament-cluster` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-cluster Settings
```

This will create a new cluster class in the `app/Filament/Clusters` directory:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Clusters\Settings;

use BackedEnum;
use Filament\Clusters\Cluster;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

class SettingsCluster extends Cluster
{
    protected static string | BackedEnum | null $navigationIcon = Heroicon::OutlinedSquares2x2;
}
```

The [`$navigationIcon`](../navigation#customizing-a-navigation-items-icon) property is defined by default since you will most likely want to customize this immediately. All other [navigation properties and methods](../navigation) are also available to use, including [`$navigationLabel`](../navigation#customizing-a-navigation-items-label), [`$navigationSort`](../navigation#sorting-navigation-items) and [`$navigationGroup`](../navigation#grouping-navigation-items). These are used to customize the cluster's main navigation item, in the same way you would customize the item for a resource or page.

## Adding resources and pages to a cluster

To add resources and pages to a cluster, you just need to define the `$cluster` property on the resource or page class, and set it to the cluster class [you created](#creating-a-cluster):

```php
use App\Filament\Clusters\Settings;

protected static ?string $cluster = SettingsCluster::class;
```

## Code structure recommendations for panels using clusters

When using clusters, it is recommended that you move all of your resources and pages into a directory with the same name as the cluster. For example, here is a directory structure for a panel that uses a cluster called `Settings`, containing a `ColorResource` and two custom pages:

```
.
+-- Clusters
|   +-- Settings
|   |   +-- SettingsCluster.php
|   |   +-- Pages
|   |   |   +-- ManageBranding.php
|   |   |   +-- ManageNotifications.php
|   |   +-- Resources
|   |   |   +-- ColorResource.php
|   |   |   +-- ColorResource
|   |   |   |   +-- Pages
|   |   |   |   |   +-- CreateColor.php
|   |   |   |   |   +-- EditColor.php
|   |   |   |   |   +-- ListColors.php
```

This is a recommendation, not a requirement. You can structure your panel however you like, as long as the resources and pages in your cluster use the [`$cluster`](#adding-resources-and-pages-to-a-cluster) property. This is just a suggestion to help you keep your panel organized.

When a cluster exists in your panel, and you generate new resources or pages with the `make:filament-resource` or `make:filament-page` commands, you will be asked if you want to create them inside a cluster directory, according to these guidelines. If you choose to, then Filament will also assign the correct `$cluster` property to the resource or page class for you. If you do not, you will need to [define the `$cluster` property](#adding-resources-and-pages-to-a-cluster) yourself.

## Setting the sub-navigation position for all pages in a cluster

The sub-navigation is rendered at the start of each page by default. It can be customized per-page, but you can also customize it for the entire cluster at once by setting the `$subNavigationPosition` property. The value may be `SubNavigationPosition::Start`, `SubNavigationPosition::End`, or `SubNavigationPosition::Top` to render the sub-navigation as tabs:

```php
use Filament\Pages\Enums\SubNavigationPosition;

protected static ?SubNavigationPosition $subNavigationPosition = SubNavigationPosition::End;
```

## Customizing the cluster breadcrumb

The cluster's name is in the breadcrumbs of all resources and pages in the cluster.

You may customize the breadcrumb name using the `$clusterBreadcrumb` property in the cluster class:

```php
protected static ?string $clusterBreadcrumb = 'cluster';
```

Alternatively, you may use the `getClusterBreadcrumb()` to define a dynamic breadcrumb name:

```php
public static function getClusterBreadcrumb(): string
{
    return __('filament/clusters/cluster.name');
}
```

<!-- Source: docs/07-users/01-overview.md -->

---
title: Overview
---

## Introduction

By default, all `App\Models\User`s can access Filament locally. To allow them to access Filament in production, you must take a few extra steps to ensure that only the correct users have access to the app.

## Authorizing access to the panel

To set up your `App\Models\User` to access Filament in non-local environments, you must implement the `FilamentUser` contract:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Panel;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser
{
    // ...

    public function canAccessPanel(Panel $panel): bool
    {
        return str_ends_with($this->email, '@yourdomain.com') && $this->hasVerifiedEmail();
    }
}
```

The `canAccessPanel()` method returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the user is allowed to access the `$panel`. In this example, we check if the user's email ends with `@yourdomain.com` and if they have verified their email address.

Since you have access to the current `$panel`, you can write conditional checks for separate panels. For example, only restricting access to the admin panel while allowing all users to access the other panels of your app:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Panel;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser
{
    // ...

    public function canAccessPanel(Panel $panel): bool
    {
        if ($panel->getId() === 'admin') {
            return str_ends_with($this->email, '@yourdomain.com') && $this->hasVerifiedEmail();
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

## Authorizing access to Resources

See the [Authorization](resources#authorization) section in the Resource documentation for controlling access to Resource pages and their data records.

## Setting up user avatars

Out of the box, Filament uses [ui-avatars.com](https://ui-avatars.com) to generate avatars based on a user's name. However, if your user model has an `avatar_url` attribute, that will be used instead. To customize how Filament gets a user's avatar URL, you can implement the `HasAvatar` contract:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasAvatar;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser, HasAvatar
{
    // ...

    public function getFilamentAvatarUrl(): ?string
    {
        return $this->avatar_url;
    }
}
```

The `getFilamentAvatarUrl()` method is used to retrieve the avatar of the current user. If `null` is returned from this method, Filament will fall back to [ui-avatars.com](https://ui-avatars.com).

### Using a different avatar provider

You can easily swap out [ui-avatars.com](https://ui-avatars.com) for a different service, by creating a new avatar provider.

In this example, we create a new file at `app/Filament/AvatarProviders/BoringAvatarsProvider.php` for [boringavatars.com](https://boringavatars.com). The `get()` method accepts a user model instance and returns an avatar URL for that user:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\AvatarProviders;

use Filament\AvatarProviders\Contracts;
use Filament\Facades\Filament;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class BoringAvatarsProvider implements Contracts\AvatarProvider
{
    public function get(Model | Authenticatable $record): string
    {
        $name = str(Filament::getNameForDefaultAvatar($record))
            ->trim()
            ->explode(' ')
            ->map(fn (string $segment): string => filled($segment) ? mb_substr($segment, 0, 1) : '')
            ->join(' ');

        return 'https://source.boringavatars.com/beam/120/' . urlencode($name);
    }
}
```

Now, register this new avatar provider in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use App\Filament\AvatarProviders\BoringAvatarsProvider;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->defaultAvatarProvider(BoringAvatarsProvider::class);
}
```

## Configuring the user's name attribute

By default, Filament will use the `name` attribute of the user to display their name in the app. To change this, you can implement the `HasName` contract:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasName;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser, HasName
{
    // ...

    public function getFilamentName(): string
    {
        return "{$this->first_name} {$this->last_name}";
    }
}
```

The `getFilamentName()` method is used to retrieve the name of the current user.

## Authentication features

You can easily enable authentication features for a panel in the configuration file:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->login()
        ->registration()
        ->passwordReset()
        ->emailVerification()
        ->emailChangeVerification()
        ->profile();
}
```

Filament also supports multi-factor authentication, which you can learn about in the [Multi-factor authentication](multi-factor-authentication) section.

### Customizing the authentication features

If you'd like to replace these pages with your own, you can pass in any Filament page class to these methods.

Most people will be able to make their desired customizations by extending the base page class from the Filament codebase, overriding methods like `form()`, and then passing the new page class in to the configuration:

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Auth\EditProfile;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->profile(EditProfile::class);
}
```

In this example, we will customize the profile page. We need to create a new PHP class at `app/Filament/Pages/Auth/EditProfile.php`:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Pages\Auth;

use Filament\Auth\Pages\EditProfile as BaseEditProfile;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

class EditProfile extends BaseEditProfile
{
    public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
    {
        return $schema
            ->components([
                TextInput::make('username')
                    ->required()
                    ->maxLength(255),
                $this->getNameFormComponent(),
                $this->getEmailFormComponent(),
                $this->getPasswordFormComponent(),
                $this->getPasswordConfirmationFormComponent(),
            ]);
    }
}
```

This class extends the base profile page class from the Filament codebase. Other page classes you could extend include:

- `Filament\Pages\Auth\Login`
- `Filament\Pages\Auth\Register`
- `Filament\Pages\Auth\EmailVerification\EmailVerificationPrompt`
- `Filament\Pages\Auth\PasswordReset\RequestPasswordReset`
- `Filament\Pages\Auth\PasswordReset\ResetPassword`

In the `form()` method of the example, we call methods like `getNameFormComponent()` to get the default form components for the page. You can customize these components as required. For all the available customization options, see the base `EditProfile` page class in the Filament codebase - it contains all the methods that you can override to make changes.

#### Customizing an authentication field without needing to re-define the form

If you'd like to customize a field in an authentication form without needing to define a new `form()` method, you could extend the specific field method and chain your customizations:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Component;

protected function getPasswordFormComponent(): Component
{
    return parent::getPasswordFormComponent()
        ->revealable(false);
}
```

### Email change verification

If you're using the `profile()` feature with the `emailChangeVerification()` feature, users that change their email address from the profile form will be required to verify their new email address before they can log in with it. This is done by sending a verification email to the new address, which contains a link that the user must click to verify their new email address. The email address in the database is not updated until the user clicks the link in the email.

The link that a user is sent is valid for 60 minutes. At the same time as the email to the new address is sent, an email to the old address is also sent, with a link to block the change. This is a security feature to potentially prevent a user from being affected by a malicious actor.

### Using a sidebar on the profile page

By default, the profile page does not use the standard page layout with a sidebar. This is so that it works with the [tenancy](tenancy) feature, otherwise it would not be accessible if the user had no tenants, since the sidebar links are routed to the current tenant.

If you aren't using [tenancy](tenancy) in your panel, and you'd like the profile page to use the standard page layout with a sidebar, you can pass the `isSimple: false` parameter to `$panel->profile()` when registering the page:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->profile(isSimple: false);
}
```

### Customizing the authentication route slugs

You can customize the URL slugs used for the authentication routes in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->loginRouteSlug('login')
        ->registrationRouteSlug('register')
        ->passwordResetRoutePrefix('password-reset')
        ->passwordResetRequestRouteSlug('request')
        ->passwordResetRouteSlug('reset')
        ->emailVerificationRoutePrefix('email-verification')
        ->emailVerificationPromptRouteSlug('prompt')
        ->emailVerificationRouteSlug('verify')
        ->emailChangeVerificationRoutePrefix('email-change-verification')
        ->emailChangeVerificationRouteSlug('verify');
}
```

### Setting the authentication guard

To set the authentication guard that Filament uses, you can pass in the guard name to the `authGuard()` [configuration](../panel-configuration) method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->authGuard('web');
}
```

### Setting the password broker

To set the password broker that Filament uses, you can pass in the broker name to the `authPasswordBroker()` [configuration](../panel-configuration) method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->authPasswordBroker('users');
}
```

### Disabling revealable password inputs

By default, all password inputs in authentication forms are [`revealable()`](../forms/text-input#revealable-password-inputs). This allows the user can see a plain text version of the password they're typing by clicking a button. To disable this feature, you can pass `false` to the `revealablePasswords()` [configuration](../panel-configuration) method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->revealablePasswords(false);
}
```

You could also disable this feature on a per-field basis by calling `->revealable(false)` on the field object when [extending the base page class](#customizing-an-authentication-field-without-needing-to-re-define-the-form).

## Setting up guest access to a panel

By default, Filament expects to work with authenticated users only. To allow guests to access a panel, you need to avoid using components which expect a signed-in user (such as profiles, avatars), and remove the built-in Authentication middleware:

- Remove the default `Authenticate::class` from the `authMiddleware()` array in the panel configuration.
- Remove `->login()` and any other [authentication features](#authentication-features) from the panel.
- Remove the default `AccountWidget` from the `widgets()` array, because it reads the current user's data.

### Authorizing guests in policies

When present, Filament relies on [Laravel Model Policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#generating-policies) for access control. To give read-access for [guest users in a model policy](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#guest-users), create the Policy and update the `viewAny()` and `view()` methods, changing the `User $user` param to `?User $user` so that it's optional, and `return true;`. Alternatively, you can remove those methods from the policy entirely.

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

## Introduction

Users in Filament can sign in with their email address and password by default. However, you can enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security to your users' accounts.

When MFA is enabled, users must perform an extra step before they are authenticated and have access to the application.

Filament includes two methods of MFA which you can enable out of the box:

- [App authentication](#app-authentication) uses a Google Authenticator-compatible app (such as the Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator apps) to generate a time-based one-time password (TOTP) that is used to verify the user.
- [Email authentication](#email-authentication) sends a one-time code to the user's email address, which they must enter to verify their identity.

In Filament, users set up multi-factor authentication from their [profile page](overview#authentication-features). If you use Filament's profile page feature, setting up multi-factor authentication will automatically add the correct UI elements to the profile page:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->profile();
}
```

## App authentication

To enable app authentication in a panel, you must first add a new column to your `users` table (or whichever table is being used for your "authenticatable" Eloquent model in this panel). The column needs to store the secret key used to generate and verify the time-based one-time passwords. It can be a normal `text()` column in a migration:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->text('app_authentication_secret')->nullable();
});
```

In the `User` model, you need to ensure that this column is encrypted and `$hidden`, since this is incredibly sensitive information that should be stored securely:

```php
use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser, MustVerifyEmail
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @var array<string>
     */
    protected $hidden = [
        // ...
        'app_authentication_secret',
    ];

    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            // ...
            'app_authentication_secret' => 'encrypted',
        ];
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

Next, you should implement the `HasAppAuthentication` interface on the `User` model. This provides Filament with the necessary methods to interact with the secret code and other information about the integration:

```php
use Filament\Auth\MultiFactor\App\Contracts\HasAppAuthentication;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser, HasAppAuthentication, MustVerifyEmail
{
    // ...

    public function getAppAuthenticationSecret(): ?string
    {
        // This method should return the user's saved app authentication secret.
    
        return $this->app_authentication_secret;
    }

    public function saveAppAuthenticationSecret(?string $secret): void
    {
        // This method should save the user's app authentication secret.
    
        $this->app_authentication_secret = $secret;
        $this->save();
    }

    public function getAppAuthenticationHolderName(): string
    {
        // In a user's authentication app, each account can be represented by a "holder name".
        // If the user has multiple accounts in your app, it might be a good idea to use
        // their email address as then they are still uniquely identifiable.
    
        return $this->email;
    }
}
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    Since Filament uses an interface on your `User` model instead of assuming that the `app_authentication_secret` column exists, you can use any column name you want. You could even use a different model entirely if you want to store the secret in a different table.
</Aside>

Finally, you should activate the app authentication feature in your panel. To do this, use the `multiFactorAuthentication()` method in the [configuration](../panel-configuration), and pass a `AppAuthentication` instance to it:

```php
use Filament\Auth\MultiFactor\App\AppAuthentication;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->multiFactorAuthentication([
            AppAuthentication::make(),
        ]);
}
```

### Setting up app recovery codes

If your users lose access to their two-factor authentication app, they will be unable to sign in to your application. To prevent this, you can generate a set of recovery codes that users can use to sign in if they lose access to their two-factor authentication app.

In a similar way to the `app_authentication_secret` column, you should add a new column to your `users` table (or whichever table is being used for your "authenticatable" Eloquent model in this panel). The column needs to store the recovery codes. It can be a normal `text()` column in a migration:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->text('app_authentication_recovery_codes')->nullable();
});
```

In the `User` model, you need to ensure that this column is encrypted as an array and `$hidden`, since this is incredibly sensitive information that should be stored securely:

```php
use Filament\Auth\MultiFactor\App\Contracts\HasAppAuthentication;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser, HasAppAuthentication, MustVerifyEmail
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @var array<string>
     */
    protected $hidden = [
        // ...
        'app_authentication_recovery_codes',
    ];

    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            // ...
            'app_authentication_recovery_codes' => 'encrypted:array',
        ];
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

Next, you should implement the `HasAppAuthenticationRecovery` interface on the `User` model. This provides Filament with the necessary methods to interact with the recovery codes:

```php
use Filament\Auth\MultiFactor\App\Contracts\HasAppAuthentication;
use Filament\Auth\MultiFactor\App\Contracts\HasAppAuthenticationRecovery;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser, HasAppAuthentication, HasAppAuthenticationRecovery, MustVerifyEmail
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @return ?array<string>
     */
    public function getAppAuthenticationRecoveryCodes(): ?array
    {
        // This method should return the user's saved app authentication recovery codes.
    
        return $this->app_authentication_recovery_codes;
    }

    /**
     * @param  array<string> | null  $codes
     */
    public function saveAppAuthenticationRecoveryCodes(?array $codes): void
    {
        // This method should save the user's app authentication recovery codes.
    
        $this->app_authentication_recovery_codes = $codes;
        $this->save();
    }
}
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    Since Filament uses an interface on your `User` model instead of assuming that the `app_authentication_recovery_codes` column exists, you can use any column name you want. You could even use a different model entirely if you want to store the recovery codes in a different table.
</Aside>

Finally, you should activate the app authentication recovery codes feature in your panel. To do this, pass the `recoverable()` method to the `AppAuthentication` instance in the `multiFactorAuthentication()` method in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Auth\MultiFactor\App\AppAuthentication;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->multiFactorAuthentication([
            AppAuthentication::make()
                ->recoverable(),
        ]);
}
```

#### Changing the number of recovery codes that are generated

By default, Filament generates 8 recovery codes for each user. If you want to change this, you can use the `recoveryCodeCount()` method on the `AppAuthentication` instance in the `multiFactorAuthentication()` method in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Auth\MultiFactor\App\AppAuthentication;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->multiFactorAuthentication([
            AppAuthentication::make()
                ->recoverable()
                ->recoveryCodeCount(10),
        ]);
}
```

#### Preventing users from regenerating their recovery codes

By default, users can visit their profile to regenerate their recovery codes. If you want to prevent this, you can use the `regenerableRecoveryCodes(false)` method on the `AppAuthentication` instance in the `multiFactorAuthentication()` method in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Auth\MultiFactor\App\AppAuthentication;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->multiFactorAuthentication([
            AppAuthentication::make()
                ->recoverable()
                ->regenerableRecoveryCodes(false),
        ]);
}
```

### Changing the app code expiration time

App codes are issued using a time-based one-time password (TOTP) algorithm, which means that they are only valid for a short period of time before and after the time they are generated. The time is defined in a "window" of time. By default, Filament uses an expiration window of `8`, which creates a 4-minute validity period on either side of the generation time (8 minutes in total).

To change the window, for example to only be valid for 2 minutes after it is generated, you can use the `codeWindow()` method on the `AppAuthentication` instance, set to `4`:

```php
use Filament\Auth\MultiFactor\App\AppAuthentication;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->multiFactorAuthentication([
            AppAuthentication::make()
                ->codeWindow(4),
        ]);
}
```

### Customizing the app authentication brand name

Each app authentication integration has a "brand name" that is displayed in the authentication app. By default, this is the name of your app. If you want to change this, you can use the `brandName()` method on the `AppAuthentication` instance in the `multiFactorAuthentication()` method in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Auth\MultiFactor\App\AppAuthentication;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->multiFactorAuthentication([
            AppAuthentication::make()
                ->brandName('Filament Demo'),
        ]);
}
```

## Email authentication

Email authentication sends the user one-time codes to their email address, which they must enter to verify their identity.

To enable email authentication in a panel, you must first add a new column to your `users` table (or whichever table is being used for your "authenticatable" Eloquent model in this panel). The column needs to store a boolean indicating whether or not email authentication is enabled:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->boolean('has_email_authentication')->default(false);
});
```

In the `User` model, you need to ensure that this column is cast to a boolean:

```php
use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser, MustVerifyEmail
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            // ...
            'has_email_authentication' => 'boolean',
        ];
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

Next, you should implement the `HasEmailAuthentication` interface on the `User` model. This provides Filament with the necessary methods to interact with the column that indicates whether or not email authentication is enabled:

```php
use Filament\Auth\MultiFactor\Email\Contracts\HasEmailAuthentication;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser, HasEmailAuthentication, MustVerifyEmail
{
    // ...

    public function hasEmailAuthentication(): bool
    {
        // This method should return true if the user has enabled email authentication.
        
        return $this->has_email_authentication;
    }

    public function toggleEmailAuthentication(bool $condition): void
    {
        // This method should save whether or not the user has enabled email authentication.
    
        $this->has_email_authentication = $condition;
        $this->save();
    }
}
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    Since Filament uses an interface on your `User` model instead of assuming that the `has_email_authentication` column exists, you can use any column name you want. You could even use a different model entirely if you want to store the setting in a different table.
</Aside>

Finally, you should activate the email authentication feature in your panel. To do this, use the `multiFactorAuthentication()` method in the [configuration](../panel-configuration), and pass an `EmailAuthentication` instance to it:

```php
use Filament\Auth\MultiFactor\Email\EmailAuthentication;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->multiFactorAuthentication([
            EmailAuthentication::make(),
        ]);
}
```

### Changing the email code expiration time

Email codes are issued with an lifetime of 4 minutes, after which they expire.

To change the expiration period, for example to only be valid for 2 minutes after codes are generated, you can use the `codeExpiryMinutes()` method on the `EmailAuthentication` instance, set to `2`:

```php
use Filament\Auth\MultiFactor\Email\EmailAuthentication;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->multiFactorAuthentication([
            EmailAuthentication::make()
                ->codeExpiryMinutes(2),
        ]);
}
```

## Requiring multi-factor authentication

By default, users are not required to set up multi-factor authentication. You can require users to configure it by passing `isRequired: true` as a parameter to the `multiFactorAuthentication()` method in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Auth\MultiFactor\App\AppAuthentication;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->multiFactorAuthentication([
            AppAuthentication::make(),
        ], isRequired: true);
}
```

When this is enabled, users will be prompted to set up multi-factor authentication after they sign in, if they have not already done so.

## Security notes about multi-factor authentication

In Filament, the multi-factor authentication process occurs before the user is actually authenticated into the app. This allows you to be sure that no users can authenticate and access the app without passing the multi-factor authentication step. You do not need to remember to add middleware to any of your authenticated routes to ensure that users completed the multi-factor authentication step.

However, if you have other parts of your Laravel app that authenticate users, please bear in mind that they will not be challenged for multi-factor authentication if they are already authenticated elsewhere and then visit the panel, unless [multi-factor authentication is required](#requiring-multi-factor-authentication) and they have not set it up yet.

title: Multi-tenancy
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

## Introduction

Multi-tenancy is a concept where a single instance of an application serves multiple customers. Each customer has their own data and access rules that prevent them from viewing or modifying each other's data. This is a common pattern in SaaS applications. Users often belong to groups of users (often called teams or organizations). Records are owned by the group, and users can be members of multiple groups. This is suitable for applications where users need to collaborate on data.

Multi-tenancy is a very sensitive topic. It's important to understand the security implications of multi-tenancy and how to properly implement it. If implemented partially or incorrectly, data belonging to one tenant may be exposed to another tenant. Filament provides a set of tools to help you implement multi-tenancy in your application, but it is up to you to understand how to use them.

<Aside variant="warning">
    Filament does not provide any guarantees about the security of your application. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application is secure. Please see the [security](#tenancy-security) section for more information.
</Aside>

## Simple one-to-many tenancy

The term "multi-tenancy" is broad and may mean different things in different contexts. Filament's tenancy system implies that the user belongs to **many** tenants (*organizations, teams, companies, etc.*) and may switch between them.

If your case is simpler and you don't need a many-to-many relationship, then you don't need to set up the tenancy in Filament. You could use [observers](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#observers) and [global scopes](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#global-scopes) instead.

Let's say you have a database column `users.team_id`, you can scope all records to have the same `team_id` as the user using a [global scope](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#global-scopes):

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

class Post extends Model
{
    protected static function booted(): void
    {
        static::addGlobalScope('team', function (Builder $query) {
            if (auth()->hasUser()) {
                $query->where('team_id', auth()->user()->team_id);
                // or with a `team` relationship defined:
                $query->whereBelongsTo(auth()->user()->team);
            }
        });
    }
}
```

To automatically set the `team_id` on the record when it's created, you can create an [observer](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#observers):

```php
class PostObserver
{
    public function creating(Post $post): void
    {
        if (auth()->hasUser()) {
            $post->team_id = auth()->user()->team_id;
            // or with a `team` relationship defined:
            $post->team()->associate(auth()->user()->team);
        }
    }
}
```

## Setting up tenancy

To set up tenancy, you'll need to specify the "tenant" (like team or organization) model in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use App\Models\Team;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenant(Team::class);
}
```

You'll also need to tell Filament which tenants a user belongs to. You can do this by implementing the `HasTenants` interface on the `App\Models\User` model:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasTenants;
use Filament\Panel;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsToMany;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser, HasTenants
{
    // ...

    public function teams(): BelongsToMany
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Team::class);
    }

    public function getTenants(Panel $panel): Collection
    {
        return $this->teams;
    }

    public function canAccessTenant(Model $tenant): bool
    {
        return $this->teams()->whereKey($tenant)->exists();
    }
}
```

In this example, users belong to many teams, so there is a `teams()` relationship. The `getTenants()` method returns the teams that the user belongs to. Filament uses this to list the tenants that the user has access to.

For security, you also need to implement the `canAccessTenant()` method of the `HasTenants` interface to prevent users from accessing the data of other tenants by guessing their tenant ID and putting it into the URL.

You'll also want users to be able to [register new teams](#adding-a-tenant-registration-page).

## Adding a tenant registration page

A registration page will allow users to create a new tenant.

When visiting your app after logging in, users will be redirected to this page if they don't already have a tenant.

To set up a registration page, you'll need to create a new page class that extends `Filament\Pages\Tenancy\RegisterTenant`. This is a full-page Livewire component. You can put this anywhere you want, such as `app/Filament/Pages/Tenancy/RegisterTeam.php`:

```php
namespace App\Filament\Pages\Tenancy;

use App\Models\Team;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Pages\Tenancy\RegisterTenant;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

class RegisterTeam extends RegisterTenant
{
    public static function getLabel(): string
    {
        return 'Register team';
    }

    public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
    {
        return $schema
            ->components([
                TextInput::make('name'),
                // ...
            ]);
    }

    protected function handleRegistration(array $data): Team
    {
        $team = Team::create($data);

        $team->members()->attach(auth()->user());

        return $team;
    }
}
```

You may add any [form components](../forms) to the `form()` method, and create the team inside the `handleRegistration()` method.

Now, we need to tell Filament to use this page. We can do this in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Tenancy\RegisterTeam;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantRegistration(RegisterTeam::class);
}
```

### Customizing the tenant registration page

You can override any method you want on the base registration page class to make it act as you want. Even the `$view` property can be overridden to use a custom view of your choice.

## Adding a tenant profile page

A profile page will allow users to edit information about the tenant.

To set up a profile page, you'll need to create a new page class that extends `Filament\Pages\Tenancy\EditTenantProfile`. This is a full-page Livewire component. You can put this anywhere you want, such as `app/Filament/Pages/Tenancy/EditTeamProfile.php`:

```php
namespace App\Filament\Pages\Tenancy;

use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Pages\Tenancy\EditTenantProfile;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

class EditTeamProfile extends EditTenantProfile
{
    public static function getLabel(): string
    {
        return 'Team profile';
    }

    public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
    {
        return $schema
            ->components([
                TextInput::make('name'),
                // ...
            ]);
    }
}
```

You may add any [form components](../forms) to the `form()` method. They will get saved directly to the tenant model.

Now, we need to tell Filament to use this page. We can do this in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Tenancy\EditTeamProfile;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantProfile(EditTeamProfile::class);
}
```

### Customizing the tenant profile page

You can override any method you want on the base profile page class to make it act as you want. Even the `$view` property can be overridden to use a custom view of your choice.

## Accessing the current tenant

Anywhere in the app, you can access the tenant model for the current request using `Filament::getTenant()`:

```php
use Filament\Facades\Filament;

$tenant = Filament::getTenant();
```

## Billing

### Using Laravel Spark

Filament provides a billing integration with [Laravel Spark](https://spark.laravel.com). Your users can start subscriptions and manage their billing information.

To install the integration, first [install Spark](https://spark.laravel.com/docs/installation.html) and configure it for your tenant model.

Now, you can install the Filament billing provider for Spark using Composer:

```bash
composer require filament/spark-billing-provider
```

In the [configuration](../panel-configuration), set Spark as the `tenantBillingProvider()`:

```php
use Filament\Billing\Providers\SparkBillingProvider;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantBillingProvider(new SparkBillingProvider());
}
```

Now, you're all good to go! Users can manage their billing by clicking a link in the tenant menu.

### Requiring a subscription

To require a subscription to use any part of the app, you can use the `requiresTenantSubscription()` configuration method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->requiresTenantSubscription();
}
```

Now, users will be redirected to the billing page if they don't have an active subscription.

#### Requiring a subscription for specific resources and pages

Sometimes, you may wish to only require a subscription for certain [resources](resources) and [custom pages](../navigation/custom-pages) in your app. You can do this by returning `true` from the `isTenantSubscriptionRequired()` method on the resource or page class:

```php
public static function isTenantSubscriptionRequired(Panel $panel): bool
{
    return true;
}
```

If you're using the `requiresTenantSubscription()` configuration method, then you can return `false` from this method to allow access to the resource or page as an exception.

### Writing a custom billing integration

Billing integrations are quite simple to write. You just need a class that implements the `Filament\Billing\Providers\Contracts\Provider` interface. This interface has two methods.

`getRouteAction()` is used to get the route action that should be run when the user visits the billing page. This could be a callback function, or the name of a controller, or a Livewire component - anything that works when using `Route::get()` in Laravel normally. For example, you could put in a simple redirect to your own billing page using a callback function.

`getSubscribedMiddleware()` returns the name of a middleware that should be used to check if the tenant has an active subscription. This middleware should redirect the user to the billing page if they don't have an active subscription.

Here's an example billing provider that uses a callback function for the route action and a middleware for the subscribed middleware:

```php
use App\Http\Middleware\RedirectIfUserNotSubscribed;
use Filament\Billing\Providers\Contracts\BillingProvider;
use Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse;

class ExampleBillingProvider implements BillingProvider
{
    public function getRouteAction(): string
    {
        return function (): RedirectResponse {
            return redirect('https://billing.example.com');
        };
    }

    public function getSubscribedMiddleware(): string
    {
        return RedirectIfUserNotSubscribed::class;
    }
}
```

### Customizing the billing route slug

You can customize the URL slug used for the billing route using the `tenantBillingRouteSlug()` method in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantBillingRouteSlug('billing');
}
```

## Customizing the tenant menu

The tenant-switching menu is featured in the admin layout. It's fully customizable.

Each menu item is represented by an [action](../actions), and can be customized in the same way. To register new items, you can pass the actions to the `tenantMenuItems()` method of the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Settings;
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMenuItems([
            Action::make('settings')
                ->url(fn (): string => Settings::getUrl())
                ->icon('heroicon-m-cog-8-tooth'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

### Customizing the registration link

To customize the [registration](#adding-a-tenant-registration-page) link in the tenant menu, register a new item with the `register` array key, and pass a function that [customizes the action](../actions) object:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMenuItems([
            'register' => fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Register new team'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

### Customizing the profile link

To customize the user profile link at the start of the tenant menu, register a new item with the `profile` array key, and pass a function that [customizes the action](../actions) object:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMenuItems([
            'profile' => fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Edit team profile'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

### Customizing the billing link

To customize the billing link in the tenant menu, register a new item with the `profile` array key, and pass a function that [customizes the action](../actions) object:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMenuItems([
            'billing' => fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Manage subscription'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

### Conditionally hiding tenant menu items

You can also conditionally hide a tenant menu item by using the `visible()` or `hidden()` methods, passing in a condition to check. Passing a function will defer condition evaluation until the menu is actually being rendered:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('settings')
    ->visible(fn (): bool => auth()->user()->can('manage-team'))
    // or
    ->hidden(fn (): bool => ! auth()->user()->can('manage-team'))
```

### Sending a `POST` HTTP request from a tenant menu item

You can send a `POST` HTTP request from a tenant menu item by passing a URL to the `url()` method, and also using `postToUrl()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('lockSession')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('lock-session'))
    ->postToUrl()
```

### Hiding the tenant menu

You can hide the tenant menu by using the `tenantMenu(false)`

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMenu(false);
}
```

However, this is a sign that Filament's tenancy feature is not suitable for your project. If each user only belongs to one tenant, you should stick to [simple one-to-many tenancy](#simple-one-to-many-tenancy).

## Setting up avatars

Out of the box, Filament uses [ui-avatars.com](https://ui-avatars.com) to generate avatars based on a user's name. However, if you user model has an `avatar_url` attribute, that will be used instead. To customize how Filament gets a user's avatar URL, you can implement the `HasAvatar` contract:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasAvatar;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Team extends Model implements HasAvatar
{
    // ...

    public function getFilamentAvatarUrl(): ?string
    {
        return $this->avatar_url;
    }
}
```

The `getFilamentAvatarUrl()` method is used to retrieve the avatar of the current user. If `null` is returned from this method, Filament will fall back to [ui-avatars.com](https://ui-avatars.com).

You can easily swap out [ui-avatars.com](https://ui-avatars.com) for a different service, by creating a new avatar provider. [You can learn how to do this here.](overview#using-a-different-avatar-provider)

## Configuring the tenant relationships

When creating and listing records associated with a Tenant, Filament needs access to two Eloquent relationships for each resource - an "ownership" relationship that is defined on the resource model class, and a relationship on the tenant model class. By default, Filament will attempt to guess the names of these relationships based on standard Laravel conventions. For example, if the tenant model is `App\Models\Team`, it will look for a `team()` relationship on the resource model class. And if the resource model class is `App\Models\Post`, it will look for a `posts()` relationship on the tenant model class.

### Customizing the ownership relationship name

You can customize the name of the ownership relationship used across all resources at once, using the `ownershipRelationship` argument on the `tenant()` configuration method. In this example, resource model classes have an `owner` relationship defined:

```php
use App\Models\Team;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenant(Team::class, ownershipRelationship: 'owner');
}
```

Alternatively, you can set the `$tenantOwnershipRelationshipName` static property on the resource class, which can then be used to customize the ownership relationship name that is just used for that resource. In this example, the `Post` model class has an `owner` relationship defined:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Resource;

class PostResource extends Resource
{
    protected static ?string $tenantOwnershipRelationshipName = 'owner';

    // ...
}
```

### Customizing the resource relationship name

You can set the `$tenantRelationshipName` static property on the resource class, which can then be used to customize the relationship name that is used to fetch that resource. In this example, the tenant model class has an `blogPosts` relationship defined:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Resource;

class PostResource extends Resource
{
    protected static ?string $tenantRelationshipName = 'blogPosts';

    // ...
}
```

## Configuring the slug attribute

When using a tenant like a team, you might want to add a slug field to the URL rather than the team's ID. You can do that with the `slugAttribute` argument on the `tenant()` configuration method:

```php
use App\Models\Team;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenant(Team::class, slugAttribute: 'slug');
}
```

## Configuring the name attribute

By default, Filament will use the `name` attribute of the tenant to display its name in the app. To change this, you can implement the `HasName` contract:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasName;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Team extends Model implements HasName
{
    // ...

    public function getFilamentName(): string
    {
        return "{$this->name} {$this->subscription_plan}";
    }
}
```

The `getFilamentName()` method is used to retrieve the name of the current user.

## Setting the current tenant label

Inside the tenant switcher, you may wish to add a small label like "Active team" above the name of the current team. You can do this by implementing the `HasCurrentTenantLabel` method on the tenant model:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasCurrentTenantLabel;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Team extends Model implements HasCurrentTenantLabel
{
    // ...

    public function getCurrentTenantLabel(): string
    {
        return 'Active team';
    }
}
```

## Setting the default tenant

When signing in, Filament will redirect the user to the first tenant returned from the `getTenants()` method.

Sometimes, you might wish to change this. For example, you might store which team was last active, and redirect the user to that team instead.

To customize this, you can implement the `HasDefaultTenant` contract on the user:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasDefaultTenant;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasTenants;
use Filament\Panel;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;

class User extends Model implements FilamentUser, HasDefaultTenant, HasTenants
{
    // ...

    public function getDefaultTenant(Panel $panel): ?Model
    {
        return $this->latestTeam;
    }

    public function latestTeam(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Team::class, 'latest_team_id');
    }
}
```

## Applying middleware to tenant-aware routes

You can apply extra middleware to all tenant-aware routes by passing an array of middleware classes to the `tenantMiddleware()` method in the [panel configuration file](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMiddleware([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

By default, middleware will be run when the page is first loaded, but not on subsequent Livewire AJAX requests. If you want to run middleware on every request, you can make it persistent by passing `true` as the second argument to the `tenantMiddleware()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMiddleware([
            // ...
        ], isPersistent: true);
}
```

## Adding a tenant route prefix

By default the URL structure will put the tenant ID or slug immediately after the panel path. If you wish to prefix it with another URL segment, use the `tenantRoutePrefix()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Team;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->path('admin')
        ->tenant(Team::class)
        ->tenantRoutePrefix('team');
}
```

Before, the URL structure was `/admin/1` for tenant 1. Now, it is `/admin/team/1`.

## Using a domain to identify the tenant

When using a tenant, you might want to use domain or subdomain routing like `team1.example.com/posts` instead of a route prefix like `/team1/posts` . You can do that with the `tenantDomain()` method, alongside the `tenant()` configuration method. The `tenant` argument corresponds to the slug attribute of the tenant model:

```php
use App\Models\Team;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenant(Team::class, slugAttribute: 'slug')
        ->tenantDomain('{tenant:slug}.example.com');
}
```

In the above examples, the tenants live on subdomains of the main app domain. You may also set the system up to resolve the entire domain from the tenant as well:

```php
use App\Models\Team;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenant(Team::class, slugAttribute: 'domain')
        ->tenantDomain('{tenant:domain}');
}
```

In this example, the `domain` attribute should contain a valid domain host, like `example.com` or `subdomain.example.com`.

<Aside variant="info">
    When using a parameter for the entire domain (`tenantDomain('{tenant:domain}')`), Filament will register a [global route parameter pattern](https://laravel.com/docs/routing#parameters-global-constraints) for all `tenant` parameters in the application to be `[a-z0-9.\-]+`. This is because Laravel does not allow the `.` character in route parameters by default. This might conflict with other panels using tenancy, or other parts of your application that use a `tenant` route parameter.
</Aside>

## Disabling tenancy for a resource

By default, all resources within a panel with tenancy will be scoped to the current tenant. If you have resources that are shared between tenants, you can disable tenancy for them by setting the `$isScopedToTenant` static property to `false` on the resource class:

```php
protected static bool $isScopedToTenant = false;
```

### Disabling tenancy for all resources

If you wish to opt-in to tenancy for each resource instead of opting-out, you can call `Resource::scopeToTenant(false)` inside a service provider's `boot()` method or a middleware:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Resource;

Resource::scopeToTenant(false);
```

Now, you can opt-in to tenancy for each resource by setting the `$isScopedToTenant` static property to `true` on a resource class:

```php
protected static bool $isScopedToTenant = true;
```

## Tenancy security

It's important to understand the security implications of multi-tenancy and how to properly implement it. If implemented partially or incorrectly, data belonging to one tenant may be exposed to another tenant. Filament provides a set of tools to help you implement multi-tenancy in your application, but it is up to you to understand how to use them. Filament does not provide any guarantees about the security of your application. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application is secure.

Below is a list of features that Filament provides to help you implement multi-tenancy in your application:

- Automatic global scoping of Eloquent model queries for [tenant-aware](#disabling-tenancy-for-a-resource) resources that belong to the panel with tenancy enabled. The query used to fetch records for a resource is automatically scoped to the current tenant. This query is used to render the resource's list table, and is also used to resolve records from the current URL when editing or viewing a record. This means that if a user attempts to view a record that does not belong to the current tenant, they will receive a 404 error.
    - A [tenant-aware](#disabling-tenancy-for-a-resource) resource has to exist in the panel with tenancy enabled for the resource's model to have the global scope applied. If you want to scope the queries for a model that does not have a corresponding resource, you must [use middleware to apply additional global scopes](#using-tenant-aware-middleware-to-apply-additional-global-scopes) for that model.
    - The global scopes are applied after the tenant has been identified from the request. This happens during the middleware stack of panel requests. If you make a query before the tenant has been identified, such as from early middleware in the stack or in a service provider, the query will not be scoped to the current tenant. To guarantee that middleware runs after the current tenant is identified, you should register it as [tenant middleware](#applying-middleware-to-tenant-aware-routes).
    - As per the point above, queries made outside the panel with tenancy enabled do not have access to the current tenant, so are not scoped. If in doubt, please check if your queries are properly scoped or not before deploying your application.
    - If you need to disable the tenancy global scope for a specific query, you can use the `withoutGlobalScope(filament()->getTenancyScopeName())` method on the query.
    - If any of your queries disable all global scopes, the tenancy global scope will be disabled as well. You should be careful when using this method, as it can lead to data leakage. If you need to disable all global scopes except the tenancy global scope, you can use the `withoutGlobalScopes()` method passing an array of the global scopes you want to disable.

- Automatic association of newly created Eloquent models with the current tenant. When a new record is created for a [tenant-aware](#disabling-tenancy-for-a-resource) resource, the tenant is automatically associated with the record. This means that the record will belong to the current tenant, as the foreign key column is automatically set to the tenant's ID. This is done by Filament registering an event listener for the `creating` and `created` events on the resource's Eloquent model. If you need to disable this feature for a specific model, you can use the `withoutTenancy()` method on the model.
    - A [tenant-aware](#disabling-tenancy-for-a-resource) resource has to exist in the panel with tenancy enabled for the resource's model to have the automatic association to happen. If you want automatic association for a model that does not have a corresponding resource, you must [register a listener for the `creating` event](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#events) for that model, and associate the `filament()->getTenant()` with it.
    - The events run after the tenant has been identified from the request. This happens during the middleware stack of panel requests. If you create a model before the tenant has been identified, such as from early middleware in the stack or in a service provider, it will not be associated with the current tenant. To guarantee that middleware runs after the current tenant is identified, you should register it as [tenant middleware](#applying-middleware-to-tenant-aware-routes).
    - As per the point above, models created outside the panel with tenancy enabled do not have access to the current tenant, so are not associated. If in doubt, please check if your models are properly associated or not before deploying your application.
    - If you need to disable the automatic association for a particular model, you can [mute the events](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#muting-events) temporarily while you create it. If any of your code currently does this or removes event listeners permanently, you should check this is not affecting the tenancy feature.

### `unique` and `exists` validation

Laravel's `unique` and `exists` validation rules do not use Eloquent models to query the database by default, so it will not use any global scopes defined on the model, including for multi-tenancy. As such, even if there is a soft-deleted record with the same value in a different tenant, the validation will fail.

If you would like two tenants to have complete data separation, you should use the `scopedUnique()` or `scopedExists()` methods instead, which replace Laravel's `unique` and `exists` implementations with ones that uses the model to query the database, applying any global scopes defined on the model, including for multi-tenancy:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('email')
    ->scopedUnique()
    // or
    ->scopedExists()
```

For more information, see the [validation documentation](../forms/validation) for [`unique()`](../forms/validation#unique) and [`exists()`](../forms/validation#exists).

### Using tenant-aware middleware to apply additional global scopes

Since only models with resources that exist in the panel are automatically scoped to the current tenant, it might be useful to apply additional tenant scoping to other Eloquent models while they are being used in your panel. This would allow you to forget about scoping your queries to the current tenant, and instead have the scoping applied automatically. To do this, you can create a new middleware class like `ApplyTenantScopes`:

```bash
php artisan make:middleware ApplyTenantScopes
```

Inside the `handle()` method, you can apply any global scopes that you wish:

```php
use App\Models\Author;
use Closure;
use Filament\Facades\Filament;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class ApplyTenantScopes
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        Author::addGlobalScope(
            'tenant',
            fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereBelongsTo(Filament::getTenant()),
        );

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

You can now [register this middleware](#applying-middleware-to-tenant-aware-routes) for all tenant-aware routes, and ensure that it is used across all Livewire AJAX requests by making it persistent:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMiddleware([
            ApplyTenantScopes::class,
        ], isPersistent: true);
}
```

## Changing the colors

In the [configuration](../panel-configuration), you can easily change the colors that are used. Filament ships with 6 predefined colors that are used everywhere within the framework. They are customizable as follows:

```php
use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->colors([
            'danger' => Color::Rose,
            'gray' => Color::Gray,
            'info' => Color::Blue,
            'primary' => Color::Indigo,
            'success' => Color::Emerald,
            'warning' => Color::Orange,
        ]);
}
```

The `Filament\Support\Colors\Color` class contains color options for all [Tailwind CSS color palettes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors).

You can also pass in a function to `register()` which will only get called when the app is getting rendered. This is useful if you are calling `register()` from a service provider, and want to access objects like the currently authenticated user, which are initialized later in middleware.

Alternatively, you may pass your own palette in as an array of OKLCH colors:

```php
$panel
    ->colors([
        'primary' => [
            50 => 'oklch(0.969 0.015 12.422)',
            100 => 'oklch(0.941 0.03 12.58)',
            200 => 'oklch(0.892 0.058 10.001)',
            300 => 'oklch(0.81 0.117 11.638)',
            400 => 'oklch(0.712 0.194 13.428)',
            500 => 'oklch(0.645 0.246 16.439)',
            600 => 'oklch(0.586 0.253 17.585)',
            700 => 'oklch(0.514 0.222 16.935)',
            800 => 'oklch(0.455 0.188 13.697)',
            900 => 'oklch(0.41 0.159 10.272)',
            950 => 'oklch(0.271 0.105 12.094)',
        ],
    ])
```

### Generating a color palette

If you want us to attempt to generate a palette for you based on a singular hex or RGB value, you can pass that in:

```php
$panel
    ->colors([
        'primary' => '#6366f1',
    ])

$panel
    ->colors([
        'primary' => 'rgb(99, 102, 241)',
    ])
```

## Changing the font

By default, we use the [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) font. You can change this using the `font()` method in the [configuration](../panel-configuration) file:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->font('Poppins');
}
```

All [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) are available to use.

### Changing the font provider

[Bunny Fonts CDN](https://fonts.bunny.net) is used to serve the fonts. It is GDPR-compliant. If you'd like to use [Google Fonts CDN](https://fonts.google.com) instead, you can do so using the `provider` argument of the `font()` method:

```php
use Filament\FontProviders\GoogleFontProvider;

$panel->font('Inter', provider: GoogleFontProvider::class)
```

Or if you'd like to serve the fonts from a local stylesheet, you can use the `LocalFontProvider`:

```php
use Filament\FontProviders\LocalFontProvider;

$panel->font(
    'Inter',
    url: asset('css/fonts.css'),
    provider: LocalFontProvider::class,
)
```

## Creating a custom theme

Filament allows you to change the CSS used to render the UI by compiling a custom stylesheet to replace the default one. This custom stylesheet is called a "theme". Themes use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

To create a custom theme for a panel, you can use the `php artisan make:filament-theme` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-theme
```

If you have multiple panels, you can specify the panel you want to create a theme for:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-theme admin
```

By default, this command will use NPM to install dependencies. If you want to use a different package manager, you can use the `--pm` option:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-theme --pm=bun
````

This command generates a CSS file in the `resources/css/filament` directory.

Add the theme's CSS file to the input array in `vite.config.js`:

```js
input: [
    // ...
    'resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css',
]
```

Now, register the Vite-compiled theme CSS file in the panel's provider:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->viteTheme('resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css');
}
```

Finally, compile the theme with Vite:

```bash
npm run build
```

<Aside variant="info">
    Check the command output for the exact file path (e.g., `app/theme.css`), as it may vary depending on your panel's ID.
</Aside>

You can now customize the theme by editing the CSS file in `resources/css/filament`.

## Using Tailwind CSS classes in your Blade views or PHP files

Even though Filament uses Tailwind CSS to compile the framework, it is not set up to automatically scan for any Tailwind classes you use in your project, so these classes will not be included in the compiled CSS.

To use Tailwind CSS classes in your project, you need to set up a [custom theme](#creating-a-custom-theme) to customize the compiled CSS file in the panel. In the `theme.css` file of the theme, you will find two lines:

```css
@source '../../../../app/Filament';
@source '../../../../resources/views/filament';
```

These lines tell Tailwind to scan the `app/Filament` and `resources/views/filament` directories for any Tailwind classes you use in your project. You can [add any other directories](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/detecting-classes-in-source-files#explicitly-registering-sources) you want to scan for Tailwind classes here.

## Disabling dark mode

To disable dark mode switching, you can use the [configuration](../panel-configuration) file:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->darkMode(false);
}
```

## Changing the default theme mode

By default, Filament uses the user's system theme as the default mode. For example, if the user's computer is in dark mode, Filament will use dark mode by default. The system mode in Filament is reactive if the user changes their computer's mode. If you want to change the default mode to force light or dark mode, you can use the `defaultThemeMode()` method, passing `ThemeMode::Light` or `ThemeMode::Dark`:

```php
use Filament\Enums\ThemeMode;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->defaultThemeMode(ThemeMode::Light);
}
```

## Adding a logo

By default, Filament uses your app's name to render a simple text-based logo. However, you can easily customize this.

If you want to simply change the text that is used in the logo, you can use the `brandName()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->brandName('Filament Demo');
}
```

To render an image instead, you can pass a URL to the `brandLogo()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->brandLogo(asset('images/logo.svg'));
}
```

Alternatively, you may directly pass HTML to the `brandLogo()` method to render an inline SVG element for example:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->brandLogo(fn () => view('filament.admin.logo'));
}
```

```blade
<svg
    viewBox="0 0 128 26"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
    class="h-full fill-gray-500 dark:fill-gray-400"
>
    <!-- ... -->
</svg>
```

If you need a different logo to be used when the application is in dark mode, you can pass it to `darkModeBrandLogo()` in the same way.

The logo height defaults to a sensible value, but it's impossible to account for all possible aspect ratios. Therefore, you may customize the height of the rendered logo using the `brandLogoHeight()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->brandLogo(fn () => view('filament.admin.logo'))
        ->brandLogoHeight('2rem');
}
```


## Adding a favicon

To add a favicon, you can use the [configuration](../panel-configuration) file, passing the public URL of the favicon:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->favicon(asset('images/favicon.png'));
}
```

title: CSS hooks

## Introduction

Filament uses CSS "hook" classes to allow various HTML elements to be customized using CSS.

## Discovering hook classes

We could document all the hook classes across the entire Filament UI, but that would be a lot of work, and probably not very useful to you. Instead, we recommend using your browser's developer tools to inspect the elements you want to customize, and then use the hook classes to target those elements.

All hook classes are prefixed with `fi-`, which is a great way to identify them. They are usually right at the start of the class list, so they are easy to find, but sometimes they may fall further down the list if we have to apply them conditionally with JavaScript or Blade.

If you don't find a hook class you're looking for, try not to hack around it, as it might expose your styling customizations to breaking changes in future releases. Instead, please open a pull request to add the hook class you need. We can help you maintain naming consistency. You probably don't even need to pull down the Filament repository locally for these pull requests, as you can just edit the Blade files directly on GitHub.

## Applying styles to hook classes

For example, if you want to customize the color of the sidebar, you can inspect the sidebar element in your browser's developer tools, see that it uses the `fi-sidebar`, and then add CSS to your app like this:

```css
.fi-sidebar {
    background-color: #fafafa;
}
```

Alternatively, since Filament is built upon Tailwind CSS, you can use their `@apply` directive to apply Tailwind classes to Filament elements:

```css
.fi-sidebar {
    @apply bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-950;
}
```

Occasionally, you may need to use the `!important` modifier to override existing styles, but please use this sparingly, as it can make your styles difficult to maintain:

```css
.fi-sidebar {
    @apply bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-950 !important;
}
```

You can even apply `!important` to only specific Tailwind classes, which is a little less intrusive, by prefixing the class name with `!`:

```css
.fi-sidebar {
    @apply !bg-gray-50 dark:!bg-gray-950;
}
```

## Common hook class abbreviations

We use a few common abbreviations in our hook classes to keep them short and readable:

- `fi` is short for "Filament"
- `fi-ac` is used to represent classes used in the Actions package
- `fi-fo` is used to represent classes used in the Forms package
- `fi-in` is used to represent classes used in the Infolists package
- `fi-no` is used to represent classes used in the Notifications package
- `fi-sc` is used to represent classes used in the Schema package
- `fi-ta` is used to represent classes used in the Tables package
- `fi-wi` is used to represent classes used in the Widgets package
- `btn` is short for "button"
- `col` is short for "column"
- `ctn` is short for "container"
- `wrp` is short for "wrapper"

## Publishing Blade views

You may be tempted to publish the internal Blade views to your application so that you can customize them. We don't recommend this, as it will introduce breaking changes into your application in future updates. Please use the [CSS hook classes](#applying-styles-to-hook-classes) wherever possible.

If you do decide to publish the Blade views, please lock all Filament packages to a specific version in your `composer.json` file, and then update Filament manually by bumping this number, testing your entire application after each update. This will help you identify breaking changes safely.

## Introduction

Filament uses CSS variables to define its color palette. These CSS variables are mapped to Tailwind classes in the preset file that you load when installing Filament. The reason why Filament uses CSS variables is that it allows the framework to pass a color palette from PHP via a `<style>` element that gets rendered as part of the `@filamentStyles` Blade directive.

By default, Filament's Tailwind preset file ships with 6 colors:

- `primary`, which is [Tailwind's `amber` color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) by default
- `success`, which is [Tailwind's `green` color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) by default
- `warning`, which is [Tailwind's `amber` color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) by default
- `danger`, which is [Tailwind's `red` color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) by default
- `info`, which is [Tailwind's `blue` color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) by default
- `gray`, which is [Tailwind's `zinc` color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) by default

You can [learn how to change these colors and register new ones](#customizing-the-default-colors).

## How to pass a color to Filament

A registered "color" in Filament is not just one shade. In fact, it is an entire color palette made of [11 shades](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors): `50`, `100`, `200`, `300`, `400`, `500`, `600`, `700`, `800`, `900`, and `950`. When you use a color in Filament, the framework will decide which shade to use based on the context. For example, it might use the `600` shade for a component's background, `500` when it is hovered, and `400` for its border. If the user has dark mode enabled, it might use `700`, `800`, or `900` instead.

On one hand, this means that you can specify a color in Filament without having to worry about the exact shade to use, or to specify a shade for each part of the component. Filament takes care of selecting a shade that should create an accessible contrast with other elements where possible.

To customize the color that something is in Filament, you can use its name. For example, if you wanted to use the `success` color, you could pass it to a color method of a PHP component like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Action::make('proceed')
    ->color('success')
    
Toggle::make('is_active')
    ->onColor('success')
```

If you would like to use a color in a [Blade component](../components), you can pass it as an attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::badge color="success">
    Active
</x-filament::badge>
```

## Customizing the default colors

From a service provider's `boot()` method, or middleware, you can call the `FilamentColor::register()` method, which you can use to customize which colors Filament uses for UI elements.

There are 6 default colors that are used throughout Filament that you are able to customize:

```php
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentColor;

FilamentColor::register([
    'danger' => Color::Red,
    'gray' => Color::Zinc,
    'info' => Color::Blue,
    'primary' => Color::Amber,
    'success' => Color::Green,
    'warning' => Color::Amber,
]);
```

The `Color` class contains every [Tailwind CSS color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#color-palette-reference) to choose from.

You can also pass in a function to `register()` which will only get called when the app is getting rendered. This is useful if you are calling `register()` from a service provider, and want to access objects like the currently authenticated user, which are initialized later in middleware.

### Registering extra colors

You may register a new color to use in any Filament component by passing it to the `FilamentColor::register()` method, with its name as the key in the array:

```php
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentColor;

FilamentColor::register([
    'secondary' => Color::Indigo,
]);
```

You will now be able to use `secondary` as a color in any Filament component.

## Using a non-Tailwind color

You can use custom colors that are not included in the [Tailwind CSS color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#color-palette-reference) palette by passing an array of color shades from `50` to `950` in OKLCH format:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentColor;

FilamentColor::register([
    'danger' => [
        50 => 'oklch(0.969 0.015 12.422)',
        100 => 'oklch(0.941 0.03 12.58)',
        200 => 'oklch(0.892 0.058 10.001)',
        300 => 'oklch(0.81 0.117 11.638)',
        400 => 'oklch(0.712 0.194 13.428)',
        500 => 'oklch(0.645 0.246 16.439)',
        600 => 'oklch(0.586 0.253 17.585)',
        700 => 'oklch(0.514 0.222 16.935)',
        800 => 'oklch(0.455 0.188 13.697)',
        900 => 'oklch(0.41 0.159 10.272)',
        950 => 'oklch(0.271 0.105 12.094)',
    ],
]);
```

### Generating a custom color palette

If you want us to attempt to generate a palette for you based on a singular hex or RGB value, you can pass that in:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentColor;

FilamentColor::register([
    'danger' => '#ff0000',
]);

FilamentColor::register([
    'danger' => 'rgb(255, 0, 0)',
]);
```

<!-- Source: docs/08-styling/04-icons.md -->

---

---
title: Icons
---

## Introduction

Icons are used throughout the entire Filament UI to visually communicate core parts of the user experience. To render icons, we use the [Blade Icons](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons) package from Blade UI Kit.

They have a website where you can [search all the available icons](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) from various Blade Icons packages. Each package contains a different icon set that you can choose from. Filament installs the "Heroicons" icon set by default, so if you are using icons from this set you do not need to install any additional packages.

## Using Heroicons in Filament

Filament includes the [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com) icon set by default. You can use any of the icons from this set in your Filament application without installing any additional packages. The `Heroicon` enum class allows you to leverage your IDE's autocompletion features to find the icon you want to use:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

Action::make('star')
    ->icon(Heroicon::OutlinedStar)
    
Toggle::make('is_starred')
    ->onIcon(Heroicon::Star)
```

Each icon comes with an "outlined" and "solid" variant, with the "outlined" variant's name being prefixed with `Outlined`. For example, the `Heroicon::Star` icon is the solid variant, while the `Heroicon::OutlinedStar` icon is the outlined variant.

The Heroicons set includes multiple sizes (16px, 20px and 24px) of solid icon, and when using the `Heroicon` enum class, Filament will automatically use the correct size for the context in which you are using it.

If you would like to use an icon in a [Blade component](../components), you can pass it as an attribute:

```blade
@php
    use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;
@endphp

<x-filament::badge :icon="Heroicon::Star">
    Star
</x-filament::badge>
```

## Using other icon sets in Filament

Once you have [found an icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search), installed the icon set (if it's not a Heroicon) you would like to use in Filament, you need to use its name. For example, if you wanted to use the [`iconic-star`](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons/iconic-star) icon, you could pass it to an icon method of a PHP component like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Action::make('star')
    ->icon('iconic-star')
    
Toggle::make('is_starred')
    ->onIcon('iconic-check-circle')
```

If you would like to use an icon in a [Blade component](../components), you can pass it as an attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::badge icon="iconic-star">
    Star
</x-filament::badge>
```

## Using custom SVGs as icons

The [Blade Icons](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons) package allows you to register custom SVGs as icons. This is useful if you want to use your own custom icons in Filament.

To start with, publish the Blade Icons configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=blade-icons
```

Now, open the `config/blade-icons.php` file, and uncomment the `default` set in the `sets` array.

Now that the default set exists in the config file, you can simply put any icons you want inside the `resources/svg` directory of your application. For example, if you put an SVG file named `star.svg` inside the `resources/svg` directory, you can reference it anywhere in Filament as `icon-star` (see below). The `icon-` prefix is configurable in the `config/blade-icons.php` file too. You can also render the custom icon in a Blade view using the [`@svg('icon-star')` directive](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons#directive).

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('star')
    ->icon('icon-star')
```

## Replacing the default icons

Filament includes an icon management system that allows you to replace any icons that are used by default in the UI with your own. This happens in the `boot()` method of any service provider, like `AppServiceProvider`, or even a dedicated service provider for icons. If you wanted to build a plugin to replace Heroicons with a different set, you could absolutely do that by creating a Laravel package with a similar service provider.

To replace an icon, you can use the `FilamentIcon` facade. It has a `register()` method, which accepts an array of icons to replace. The key of the array is the unique [icon alias](#available-icon-aliases) that identifies the icon in the Filament UI, and the value is name of a Blade icon to replace it instead. Alternatively, you may use HTML instead of an icon name to render an icon from a Blade view for example:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentIcon;
use Filament\View\PanelsIconAlias;

FilamentIcon::register([
    PanelsIconAlias::GLOBAL_SEARCH_FIELD => 'fas-magnifying-glass',
    PanelsIconAlias::SIDEBAR_GROUP_COLLAPSE_BUTTON => view('icons.chevron-up'),
]);
```

## Introduction

Filament allows you to render Blade content at various points in the frameworks views. It's useful for plugins to be able to inject HTML into the framework. Also, since Filament does not recommend publishing the views due to an increased risk of breaking changes, it's also useful for users.

## Registering render hooks

To register render hooks, you can call `FilamentView::registerRenderHook()` from a service provider or middleware. The first argument is the name of the render hook, and the second argument is a callback that returns the content to be rendered:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView;
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Blade;

FilamentView::registerRenderHook(
    PanelsRenderHook::BODY_START,
    fn (): string => Blade::render('@livewire(\'livewire-ui-modal\')'),
);
```

You could also render view content from a file:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView;
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;

FilamentView::registerRenderHook(
    PanelsRenderHook::BODY_START,
    fn (): View => view('impersonation-banner'),
);
```

## Scoping render hooks

Some render hooks can be given a "scope", which allows them to only be output on a specific page or Livewire component. For instance, you might want to register a render hook for just 1 page. To do that, you can pass the class of the page or component as the second argument to `registerRenderHook()`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView;
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Blade;

FilamentView::registerRenderHook(
    PanelsRenderHook::PAGE_START,
    fn (): View => view('warning-banner'),
    scopes: \App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\EditUser::class,
);
```

You can also pass an array of scopes to register the render hook for:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView;
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;

FilamentView::registerRenderHook(
    PanelsRenderHook::PAGE_START,
    fn (): View => view('warning-banner'),
    scopes: [
        \App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\CreateUser::class,
        \App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\EditUser::class,
    ],
);
```

Some render hooks for the [Panel Builder](#panel-builder-render-hooks) allow you to scope hooks to all pages in a resource:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView;
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;

FilamentView::registerRenderHook(
    PanelsRenderHook::PAGE_START,
    fn (): View => view('warning-banner'),
    scopes: \App\Filament\Resources\Users\UserResource::class,
);
```

### Retrieving the currently active scopes inside the render hook

The `$scopes` are passed to the render hook function, and you can use them to determine which page or component the render hook is being rendered on:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView;
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;

FilamentView::registerRenderHook(
    PanelsRenderHook::PAGE_START,
    fn (array $scopes): View => view('warning-banner', ['scopes' => $scopes]),
    scopes: \App\Filament\Resources\Users\UserResource::class,
);
```

## Passing data to render hooks

Render hooks can receive "data" from when the hook is rendered. To access data from a render hook, you can inject it using an `array $data` parameter to the hook's rendering function:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView;
use Filament\Tables\View\TablesRenderHook;

FilamentView::registerRenderHook(
    TablesRenderHook::FILTER_INDICATORS,
    fn (array $data): View => view('filter-indicators', ['indicators' => $data['filterIndicators']]),
);
```

## Rendering hooks

Plugin developers might find it useful to expose render hooks to their users. You do not need to register them anywhere, simply output them in Blade like so:

```blade
{{ \Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView::renderHook(\Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook::PAGE_START) }}
```

To provide [scope](#scoping-render-hooks) your render hook, you can pass it as the second argument to `renderHook()`. For instance, if your hook is inside a Livewire component, you can pass the class of the component using `static::class`:

```blade
{{ \Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView::renderHook(\Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook::PAGE_START, scopes: $this->getRenderHookScopes()) }}
```

You can even pass multiple scopes as an array, and all render hooks that match any of the scopes will be rendered:

```blade
{{ \Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView::renderHook(\Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook::PAGE_START, scopes: [static::class, \App\Filament\Resources\Users\UserResource::class]) }}
```

You can pass [data](#passing-data-to-render-hooks) to a render hook using a `data` argument to the `renderHook()` function:

```blade
{{ \Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView::renderHook(\Filament\Tables\View\TablesRenderHook::FILTER_INDICATORS, data: ['filterIndicators' => $filterIndicators]) }}
```

title: Registering assets
---

## Introduction

All packages in the Filament ecosystem share an asset management system. This allows both official plugins and third-party plugins to register CSS and JavaScript files that can then be consumed by Blade views.

## The `FilamentAsset` facade

The `FilamentAsset` facade is used to register files into the asset system. These files may be sourced from anywhere in the filesystem, but are then copied into the `/public` directory of the application when the `php artisan filament:assets` command is run. By copying them into the `/public` directory for you, we can predictably load them in Blade views, and also ensure that third party packages are able to load their assets without having to worry about where they are located.

Assets always have a unique ID chosen by you, which is used as the file name when the asset is copied into the `/public` directory. This ID is also used to reference the asset in Blade views. While the ID is unique, if you are registering assets for a plugin, then you do not need to worry about IDs clashing with other plugins, since the asset will be copied into a directory named after your plugin.

The `FilamentAsset` facade should be used in the `boot()` method of a service provider. It can be used inside an application service provider such as `AppServiceProvider`, or inside a plugin service provider.

The `FilamentAsset` facade has one main method, `register()`, which accepts an array of assets to register:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

public function boot(): void
{
    // ...
    
    FilamentAsset::register([
        // ...
    ]);
    
    // ...
}
```

### Registering assets for a plugin

When registering assets for a plugin, you should pass the name of the Composer package as the second argument of the `register()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::register([
    // ...
], package: 'danharrin/filament-blog');
```

Now, all the assets for this plugin will be copied into their own directory inside `/public`, to avoid the possibility of clashing with other plugins' files with the same names.

## Registering CSS files

To register a CSS file with the asset system, use the `FilamentAsset::register()` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider. You must pass in an array of `Css` objects, which each represents a CSS file that should be registered in the asset system.

Each `Css` object has a unique ID and a path to the CSS file:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\Css;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::register([
    Css::make('custom-stylesheet', __DIR__ . '/../../resources/css/custom.css'),
]);
```

In this example, we use `__DIR__` to generate a relative path to the asset from the current file. For instance, if you were adding this code to `/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`, then the CSS file should exist in `/resources/css/custom.css`.

Now, when the `php artisan filament:assets` command is run, this CSS file is copied into the `/public` directory. In addition, it is now loaded into all Blade views that use Filament. If you're interested in only loading the CSS when it is required by an element on the page, check out the [Lazy loading CSS](#lazy-loading-css) section.

### Using Tailwind CSS in plugins

Typically, registering CSS files is used to register custom stylesheets for your application. If you want to process these files using Tailwind CSS, you need to consider the implications of that, especially if you are a plugin developer.

Tailwind builds are unique to every application - they contain a minimal set of utility classes, only the ones that you are actually using in your application. This means that if you are a plugin developer, you probably should not be building your Tailwind CSS files into your plugin. Instead, you should provide the raw CSS files and instruct the user that they should build the Tailwind CSS file themselves. To do this, they probably just need to add your vendor directory into the `content` array of their `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
export default {
    content: [
        './resources/**/*.blade.php',
        './vendor/filament/**/*.blade.php',
        './vendor/danharrin/filament-blog/resources/views/**/*.blade.php', // Your plugin's vendor directory
    ],
    // ...
}
```

This means that when they build their Tailwind CSS file, it will include all the utility classes that are used in your plugin's views, as well as the utility classes that are used in their application and the Filament core.

However, with this technique, there might be extra complications for users who use your plugin with the [Panel Builder](../panels). If they have a [custom theme](../panels/themes), they will be fine, since they are building their own CSS file anyway using Tailwind CSS. However, if they are using the default stylesheet which is shipped with the Panel Builder, you might have to be careful about the utility classes that you use in your plugin's views. For instance, if you use a utility class that is not included in the default stylesheet, the user is not compiling it themselves, and it will not be included in the final CSS file. This means that your plugin's views might not look as expected. This is one of the few situations where I would recommend compiling and [registering](#registering-css-files) a Tailwind CSS-compiled stylesheet in your plugin.

### Lazy loading CSS

By default, all CSS files registered with the asset system are loaded in the `<head>` of every Filament page. This is the simplest way to load CSS files, but sometimes they may be quite heavy and not required on every page. In this case, you can leverage the [Alpine.js Lazy Load Assets](https://github.com/tanthammar/alpine-lazy-load-assets) package that comes bundled with Filament. It allows you to easily load CSS files on-demand using Alpine.js. The premise is very simple, you use the `x-load-css` directive on an element, and when that element is loaded onto the page, the specified CSS files are loaded into the `<head>` of the page. This is perfect for both small UI elements and entire pages that require a CSS file:

```blade
<div
    x-data="{}"
    x-load-css="[@js(\Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getStyleHref('custom-stylesheet'))]"
>
    <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

To prevent the CSS file from being loaded automatically, you can use the `loadedOnRequest()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\Css;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::register([
    Css::make('custom-stylesheet', __DIR__ . '/../../resources/css/custom.css')->loadedOnRequest(),
]);
```

If your CSS file was [registered to a plugin](#registering-assets-for-a-plugin), you must pass that in as the second argument to the `FilamentAsset::getStyleHref()` method:

```blade
<div
    x-data="{}"
    x-load-css="[@js(\Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getStyleHref('custom-stylesheet', package: 'danharrin/filament-blog'))]"
>
    <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

### Registering CSS files from a URL

If you want to register a CSS file from a URL, you may do so. These assets will be loaded on every page as normal, but not copied into the `/public` directory when the `php artisan filament:assets` command is run. This is useful for registering external stylesheets from a CDN, or stylesheets that you are already compiling directly into the `/public` directory:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\Css;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::register([
    Css::make('example-external-stylesheet', 'https://example.com/external.css'),
    Css::make('example-local-stylesheet', asset('css/local.css')),
]);
```

### Registering CSS variables

Sometimes, you may wish to use dynamic data from the backend in CSS files. To do this, you can use the `FilamentAsset::registerCssVariables()` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::registerCssVariables([
    'background-image' => asset('images/background.jpg'),
]);
```

Now, you can access these variables from any CSS file:

```css
background-image: var(--background-image);
```

## Registering JavaScript files

To register a JavaScript file with the asset system, use the `FilamentAsset::register()` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider. You must pass in an array of `Js` objects, which each represents a JavaScript file that should be registered in the asset system.

Each `Js` object has a unique ID and a path to the JavaScript file:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\Js;

FilamentAsset::register([
    Js::make('custom-script', __DIR__ . '/../../resources/js/custom.js'),
]);
```

In this example, we use `__DIR__` to generate a relative path to the asset from the current file. For instance, if you were adding this code to `/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`, then the JavaScript file should exist in `/resources/js/custom.js`.

Now, when the `php artisan filament:assets` command is run, this JavaScript file is copied into the `/public` directory. In addition, it is now loaded into all Blade views that use Filament. If you're interested in only loading the JavaScript when it is required by an element on the page, check out the [Lazy loading JavaScript](#lazy-loading-javascript) section.

### Lazy loading JavaScript

By default, all JavaScript files registered with the asset system are loaded at the bottom of every Filament page. This is the simplest way to load JavaScript files, but sometimes they may be quite heavy and not required on every page. In this case, you can leverage the [Alpine.js Lazy Load Assets](https://github.com/tanthammar/alpine-lazy-load-assets) package that comes bundled with Filament. It allows you to easily load JavaScript files on-demand using Alpine.js. The premise is very simple, you use the `x-load-js` directive on an element, and when that element is loaded onto the page, the specified JavaScript files are loaded at the bottom of the page. This is perfect for both small UI elements and entire pages that require a JavaScript file:

```blade
<div
    x-data="{}"
    x-load-js="[@js(\Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getScriptSrc('custom-script'))]"
>
    <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

To prevent the JavaScript file from being loaded automatically, you can use the `loadedOnRequest()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\Js;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::register([
    Js::make('custom-script', __DIR__ . '/../../resources/js/custom.js')->loadedOnRequest(),
]);
```

If your JavaScript file was [registered to a plugin](#registering-assets-for-a-plugin), you must pass that in as the second argument to the `FilamentAsset::getScriptSrc()` method:

```blade
<div
    x-data="{}"
    x-load-js="[@js(\Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getScriptSrc('custom-script', package: 'danharrin/filament-blog'))]"
>
    <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

#### Asynchronous Alpine.js components

Sometimes, you may want to load external JavaScript libraries for your Alpine.js-based components. The best way to do this is by storing the compiled JavaScript and Alpine component in a separate file, and letting us load it whenever the component is rendered.

Firstly, you should install [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) via NPM, which we will use to create a single JavaScript file containing your external library and Alpine component:

```bash
npm install esbuild --save-dev
```

Then, you must create a script to compile your JavaScript and Alpine component. You can put this anywhere, for example `bin/build.js`:

```js
import * as esbuild from 'esbuild'

const isDev = process.argv.includes('--dev')

async function compile(options) {
    const context = await esbuild.context(options)

    if (isDev) {
        await context.watch()
    } else {
        await context.rebuild()
        await context.dispose()
    }
}

const defaultOptions = {
    define: {
        'process.env.NODE_ENV': isDev ? `'development'` : `'production'`,
    },
    bundle: true,
    mainFields: ['module', 'main'],
    platform: 'neutral',
    sourcemap: isDev ? 'inline' : false,
    sourcesContent: isDev,
    treeShaking: true,
    target: ['es2020'],
    minify: !isDev,
    plugins: [{
        name: 'watchPlugin',
        setup(build) {
            build.onStart(() => {
                console.log(`Build started at ${new Date(Date.now()).toLocaleTimeString()}: ${build.initialOptions.outfile}`)
            })

            build.onEnd((result) => {
                if (result.errors.length > 0) {
                    console.log(`Build failed at ${new Date(Date.now()).toLocaleTimeString()}: ${build.initialOptions.outfile}`, result.errors)
                } else {
                    console.log(`Build finished at ${new Date(Date.now()).toLocaleTimeString()}: ${build.initialOptions.outfile}`)
                }
            })
        }
    }],
}

compile({
    ...defaultOptions,
    entryPoints: ['./resources/js/components/test-component.js'],
    outfile: './resources/js/dist/components/test-component.js',
})
```

As you can see at the bottom of the script, we are compiling a file called `resources/js/components/test-component.js` into `resources/js/dist/components/test-component.js`. You can change these paths to suit your needs. You can compile as many components as you want.

Now, create a new file called `resources/js/components/test-component.js`:

```js
// Import any external JavaScript libraries from NPM here.

export default function testComponent({
    state,
}) {
    return {
        state,
        
        // You can define any other Alpine.js properties here.

        init() {
            // Initialise the Alpine component here, if you need to.
        },
        
        // You can define any other Alpine.js functions here.
    }
}
```

Now, you can compile this file into `resources/js/dist/components/test-component.js` by running the following command:

```bash
node bin/build.js
```

If you want to watch for changes to this file instead of compiling once, try the following command:

```bash
node bin/build.js --dev
```

Now, you need to tell Filament to publish this compiled JavaScript file into the `/public` directory of the Laravel application, so it is accessible to the browser. To do this, you can use the `FilamentAsset::register()` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider, passing in an `AlpineComponent` object:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\AlpineComponent;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::register([
    AlpineComponent::make('test-component', __DIR__ . '/../../resources/js/dist/components/test-component.js'),
]);
```

When you run `php artisan filament:assets`, the compiled file will be copied into the `/public` directory.

Finally, you can load this asynchronous Alpine component in your view using `x-load` attributes and the `FilamentAsset::getAlpineComponentSrc()` method:

```blade
<div
    x-load
    x-load-src="{{ \Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getAlpineComponentSrc('test-component') }}"
    x-data="testComponent({
        state: $wire.{{ $applyStateBindingModifiers("\$entangle('{$statePath}')") }},
    })"
>
    <input x-model="state" />
</div>
```

This example is for a [custom form field](../forms/custom). It passes the `state` in as a parameter to the `testComponent()` function, which is entangled with a Livewire component property. You can pass in any parameters you want, and access them in the `testComponent()` function. If you're not using a custom form field, you can ignore the `state` parameter in this example.

The `x-load` attributes come from the [Async Alpine](https://async-alpine.dev/docs/strategies) package, and any features of that package can be used here.

### Registering script data

Sometimes, you may wish to make data from the backend available to JavaScript files. To do this, you can use the `FilamentAsset::registerScriptData()` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::registerScriptData([
    'user' => [
        'name' => auth()->user()?->name,
    ],
]);
```

Now, you can access that data from any JavaScript file at runtime, using the `window.filamentData` object:

```js
window.filamentData.user.name // 'Dan Harrin'
```

### Registering JavaScript files from a URL

If you want to register a JavaScript file from a URL, you may do so. These assets will be loaded on every page as normal, but not copied into the `/public` directory when the `php artisan filament:assets` command is run. This is useful for registering external scripts from a CDN, or scripts that you are already compiling directly into the `/public` directory:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\Js;

FilamentAsset::register([
    Js::make('example-external-script', 'https://example.com/external.js'),
    Js::make('example-local-script', asset('js/local.js')),
]);
```

title: Enum tricks
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

## Introduction

Enums are special PHP classes that represent a fixed set of constants. They are useful for modeling concepts that have a limited number of possible values, like days of the week, months in a year, or the suits in a deck of cards.

Since enum "cases" are instances of the enum class, adding interfaces to enums proves to be very useful. Filament provides a collection of interfaces that you can add to enums, which enhance your experience when working with them.

<Aside variant="warning">
    When using an enum with an attribute on your Eloquent model, please [ensure that it is cast correctly](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#enum-casting).
</Aside>

## Enum labels

The `HasLabel` interface transforms an enum instance into a textual label. This is useful for displaying human-readable enum values in your UI.

```php
use Filament\Support\Contracts\HasLabel;

enum Status: string implements HasLabel
{
    case Draft = 'draft';
    case Reviewing = 'reviewing';
    case Published = 'published';
    case Rejected = 'rejected';
    
    public function getLabel(): ?string
    {
        return $this->name;
        
        // or
    
        return match ($this) {
            self::Draft => 'Draft',
            self::Reviewing => 'Reviewing',
            self::Published => 'Published',
            self::Rejected => 'Rejected',
        };
    }
}
```

### Using the enum label with form field options

The `HasLabel` interface can be used to generate an array of options from an enum, where the enum's value is the key and the enum's label is the value. This applies to form fields like [`Select`](../forms/select) and [`CheckboxList`](../forms/checkbox-list), as well as the Table Builder's [`SelectColumn`](../tables/columns/select) and [`SelectFilter`](../tables/filters/select):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

Select::make('status')
    ->options(Status::class)

CheckboxList::make('status')
    ->options(Status::class)

Radio::make('status')
    ->options(Status::class)

SelectColumn::make('status')
    ->options(Status::class)

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options(Status::class)
```

In these examples, `Status::class` is the enum class which implements `HasLabel`, and the options are generated from that:

```php
[
    'draft' => 'Draft',
    'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
    'published' => 'Published',
    'rejected' => 'Rejected',
]
```

### Using the enum label with a text column in your table

If you use a [`TextColumn`](../tables/columns/text) with the Table Builder, and it is cast to an enum in your Eloquent model, Filament will automatically use the `HasLabel` interface to display the enum's label instead of its raw value.

### Using the enum label as a group title in your table

If you use a [grouping](../tables/grouping) with the Table Builder, and it is cast to an enum in your Eloquent model, Filament will automatically use the `HasLabel` interface to display the enum's label instead of its raw value. The label will be displayed as the [title of each group](../tables/grouping#setting-a-group-title).

### Using the enum label with a text entry in your infolist

If you use a [`TextEntry`](../infolists/text-entry) in an infolist, and it is cast to an enum in your Eloquent model, Filament will automatically use the `HasLabel` interface to display the enum's label instead of its raw value.

## Enum colors

The `HasColor` interface transforms an enum instance into a [color](colors). This is useful for displaying colored enum values in your UI.

```php
use Filament\Support\Contracts\HasColor;

enum Status: string implements HasColor
{
    case Draft = 'draft';
    case Reviewing = 'reviewing';
    case Published = 'published';
    case Rejected = 'rejected';
    
    public function getColor(): string | array | null
    {
        return match ($this) {
            self::Draft => 'gray',
            self::Reviewing => 'warning',
            self::Published => 'success',
            self::Rejected => 'danger',
        };
    }
}
```

### Using the enum color with a text column in your table

If you use a [`TextColumn`](../tables/columns/text) with the Table Builder, and it is cast to an enum in your Eloquent model, Filament will automatically use the `HasColor` interface to display the enum label in its color. This works best if you use the [`badge()`](../tables/columns/text#displaying-as-a-badge) method on the column.

### Using the enum color with a text entry in your infolist

If you use a [`TextEntry`](../infolists/text-entry) in an infolist, and it is cast to an enum in your Eloquent model, Filament will automatically use the `HasColor` interface to display the enum label in its color. This works best if you use the [`badge()`](../infolists/text#displaying-as-a-badge) method on the entry.

### Using the enum color with a toggle buttons field in your form

If you use a [`ToggleButtons`](../forms/toggle-buttons) form field, and it is set to use an enum for its options, Filament will automatically use the `HasColor` interface to display the enum label in its color.

## Enum icons

The `HasIcon` interface transforms an enum instance into an [icon](icons). This is useful for displaying icons alongside enum values in your UI.

```php
use Filament\Support\Contracts\HasIcon;

enum Status: string implements HasIcon
{
    case Draft = 'draft';
    case Reviewing = 'reviewing';
    case Published = 'published';
    case Rejected = 'rejected';
    
    public function getIcon(): ?string
    {
        return match ($this) {
            self::Draft => 'heroicon-m-pencil',
            self::Reviewing => 'heroicon-m-eye',
            self::Published => 'heroicon-m-check',
            self::Rejected => 'heroicon-m-x-mark',
        };
    }
}
```

### Using the enum icon with a text column in your table

If you use a [`TextColumn`](../tables/columns/text) with the Table Builder, and it is cast to an enum in your Eloquent model, Filament will automatically use the `HasIcon` interface to display the enum's icon aside its label. This works best if you use the [`badge()`](../tables/columns/text#displaying-as-a-badge) method on the column.

### Using the enum icon with a text entry in your infolist

If you use a [`TextEntry`](../infolists/text-entry) in an infolist, and it is cast to an enum in your Eloquent model, Filament will automatically use the `HasIcon` interface to display the enum's icon aside its label. This works best if you use the [`badge()`](../infolists/text#displaying-as-a-badge) method on the entry.

### Using the enum icon with a toggle buttons field in your form

If you use a [`ToggleButtons`](../forms/toggle-buttons) form field, and it is set to use an enum for its options, Filament will automatically use the `HasIcon` interface to display the enum's icon aside its label.

## Enum descriptions

The `HasDescription` interface transforms an enum instance into a textual description, often displayed under its [label](#enum-labels). This is useful for displaying human-friendly descriptions in your UI.

```php
use Filament\Support\Contracts\HasDescription;
use Filament\Support\Contracts\HasLabel;

enum Status: string implements HasLabel, HasDescription
{
    case Draft = 'draft';
    case Reviewing = 'reviewing';
    case Published = 'published';
    case Rejected = 'rejected';
    
    public function getLabel(): ?string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }
    
    public function getDescription(): ?string
    {
        return match ($this) {
            self::Draft => 'This has not finished being written yet.',
            self::Reviewing => 'This is ready for a staff member to read.',
            self::Published => 'This has been approved by a staff member and is public on the website.',
            self::Rejected => 'A staff member has decided this is not appropriate for the website.',
        };
    }
}
```

### Using the enum description with form field descriptions

The `HasDescription` interface can be used to generate an array of descriptions from an enum, where the enum's value is the key and the enum's description is the value. This applies to form fields like [`Radio`](../forms/radio#setting-option-descriptions) and [`CheckboxList`](../forms/checkbox-list#setting-option-descriptions):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;

Radio::make('status')
    ->options(Status::class)

CheckboxList::make('status')
    ->options(Status::class)
```

## Introduction

Filament includes many CLI commands which generate files. This guide is to explain how you can customize the generated files.

The vast majority of files that Filament generates are PHP classes. Filament uses [`nette/php-generator`](https://github.com/nette/php-generator) to generate classes programmatically, instead of using template files. The advantage of this is that there is much more flexibility in the generated files, which is important when you need to support as many different configuration options as Filament has.

Each type of class is generated by a `ClassGenerator` class. Here are a list of `ClassGenerator` classes that Filament uses:

- `Filament\Actions\Commands\FileGenerators\ExporterClassGenerator` is used by the `make:filament-exporter` command.

- `Filament\Widgets\Commands\FileGenerators\TableWidgetClassGenerator` is used by the `make:filament-widget` command.

## The anatomy of a class generator

The best way to learn about class generators is to look at their source code. They all follow very similar patterns, and use the features from [`nette/php-generator`](https://github.com/nette/php-generator).

Here are some methods to look out for:

- `__construct()` accepts the parameters that are passed into the generator. This is all the information you have access to as context for generating the class.
- `getImports()` returns the imports that are used in the class being generated. This is not an exclusive list, and imports can be added while generating properties and methods as well, if that is easier than providing them in advance.
- `getExtends()` returns the fully qualified name of the class being extended.
- `addTraitsToClass()` is used to add traits to the class being generated. The `Class` object from `nette/php-generator` is passed in as a parameter.
- `addPropertiesToClass()` is used to add properties to the class being generated. The `Class` object from `nette/php-generator` is passed in as a parameter.
- `add*PropertyToClass()` methods are used to add a single property to the class being generated. The `Class` object from `nette/php-generator` is passed in as a parameter. They are usually called from `addPropertiesToClass()`.
- `addMethodsToClass()` is used to add methods to the class being generated. The `Class` object from `nette/php-generator` is passed in as a parameter.
- `add*MethodToClass()` methods are used to add a single method to the class being generated. The `Class` object from `nette/php-generator` is passed in as a parameter. They are usually called from `addMethodsToClass()`.

## Replacing a class generator

To be able to make changes to how a file is generated, you need to identify the correct class generator (see the list above) and replace it.

To replace it, create a new class that extends the class generator you want to replace. For example, if you want to replace the `ResourceClassGenerator`, create a new class like this:

```php
namespace App\Filament\Commands\FileGenerators\Resources;

use Filament\Commands\FileGenerators\Resources\ResourceClassGenerator as BaseResourceClassGenerator;

class ResourceClassGenerator extends BaseResourceClassGenerator
{
   // ...
}
```

You also need to register it as a binding in the service container. You can do this in a service provider such as `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
use App\Filament\Commands\FileGenerators\Resources\ResourceClassGenerator;
use Filament\Commands\FileGenerators\Resources\ResourceClassGenerator as BaseResourceClassGenerator;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {
        // ...
    
        $this->app->bind(BaseResourceClassGenerator::class, ResourceClassGenerator::class);
        
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Customizing an existing property or method in a class

While viewing the source code of the class generator, locate the property or method you want to customize. You can override it in your class generator by simply defining a new method with the same name. For example, here is a method you can find for adding the `$navigationIcon` property to a resource class:

```php
use BackedEnum;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;
use Nette\PhpGenerator\ClassType;
use Nette\PhpGenerator\Literal;

protected function addNavigationIconPropertyToClass(ClassType $class): void
{
    $this->namespace->addUse(BackedEnum::class);
    $this->namespace->addUse(Heroicon::class);

    $property = $class->addProperty('navigationIcon', new Literal('Heroicon::OutlinedRectangleStack'))
        ->setProtected()
        ->setStatic()
        ->setType('string|BackedEnum|null');
    $this->configureNavigationIconProperty($property);
}
```

You could override that method to change its behavior, or you could just override the `configureNavigationIconProperty()` method to hook into how the property is configured. For example, make the property `public` instead of `protected`:

```php
use Nette\PhpGenerator\Property;

protected function configureNavigationIconProperty(Property $property): void
{
    $property->setPublic();
}
```

## Adding a new property or method to a class

To add a new property or method to a class, you can do this in the `addPropertiesToClass()` or `addMethodsToClass()` methods. To inherit the existing properties instead of replacing them, make sure you call `parent::addPropertiesToClass()` or `parent::addMethodsToClass()` at the start of your method. For example, here is how to add a new property to a resource class:

```php
use Nette\PhpGenerator\ClassType;
use Nette\PhpGenerator\Literal;

protected function addPropertiesToClass(ClassType $class): void
{
    parent::addPropertiesToClass($class);

    $class->addProperty('navigationSort', 10)
        ->setProtected()
        ->setStatic()
        ->setType('?int');
}
```

## Introduction

All examples in this guide will be written using [Pest](https://pestphp.com). To use Pest's Livewire plugin for testing, you can follow the installation instructions in the Pest documentation on plugins: [Livewire plugin for Pest](https://pestphp.com/docs/plugins#livewire). However, you can easily adapt this to PHPUnit, mostly by switching out the `livewire()` function from Pest with the `Livewire::test()` method.

Since all Filament components are mounted to a Livewire component, we're just using Livewire testing helpers everywhere. If you've never tested Livewire components before, please read [this guide](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/testing) from the Livewire docs.

## Testing guides

Looking for a full example on how to test a panel resource? Check out the [Testing resources](testing-resources) section.

If you could like to learn the different methods available to test tables, check out the [Testing tables](../tables/testing) section.

If you need to test a schema, which encompasses both forms and infolists, check out the [Testing schemas](../schemas/testing) section.

If you would like to test an action, including actions that exist in tables or in schemas, check out the [Testing actions](../actions/testing) section.

If you would like to test a notification that you have sent, check out the [Testing notifications](../notifications/testing) section.

If you would like to test a custom page in a panel, these are Livewire components with no special behavior, so you should visit the [testing](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/testing) section of the Livewire documentation.

## What is a Livewire component when using Filament?

When testing Filament, it is useful to understand which components are Livewire components and which aren't. With this information, you know which classes to pass to the `livewire()` function in Pest or the `Livewire::test()` method in PHPUnit.

Some examples of Livewire components are:

- Pages in a panel, including page classes in a resource's `Pages` directory
- Relation managers in a resource
- Widgets

Some examples of classes that are not Livewire components are:

- Resource classes
- Schema components
- Actions

These classes all interact with Livewire, but they are not Livewire components themselves. You can still test them, for example, by calling various methods and using the [Pest expectation API](https://pestphp.com/docs/expectations) to assert the expected behavior. However, the most useful tests will involve Livewire components, since they provide the best end-to-end testing coverage of your users' experience.

## Authenticating as a user

Ensure that you are authenticated to access the app in your `TestCase`:

```php
use App\Models\User;

protected function setUp(): void
{
    parent::setUp();

    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create());
}
```

Alternatively, if you are using Pest you can use a `beforeEach()` function at the top of your test file to authenticate:

```php
use App\Models\User;

beforeEach(function () {
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    actingAs($user);
});
```

## Testing a resource list page

To test if the list page is able to load, test the list page as a Livewire component, and call `assertOk()` to ensure that the HTTP response was 200 OK. You can also use the `assertCanSeeTableRecords()` method to check if records are being displayed in the table:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\ListUsers;
use App\Models\User;

it('can load the page', function () {
    $users = User::factory()->count(5)->create();

    livewire(ListUsers::class)
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users);
});
```

To test the table on the list page, you should visit the [Testing tables](testing-tables) section. To test any actions in the header of the page or actions in the table, you should visit the [Testing actions](testing-actions) section. Below are some common examples of other tests that you can run on the list page.

To [test that the table search is working](testing-tables#testing-that-a-column-can-be-searched), you can use the `searchTable()` method to search for a specific record. You can also use the `assertCanSeeTableRecords()` and `assertCanNotSeeTableRecords()` methods to check if the correct records are being displayed in the table:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\ListUsers;
use App\Models\User;

it('can search users by `name` or `email`', function () {
    $users = User::factory()->count(5)->create();

    livewire(ListUsers::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
        ->searchTable($users->first()->name)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(1))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->skip(1))
        ->searchTable($users->last()->email)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(-1))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->take($users->count() - 1));
});
```

To [test that the table sorting is working](testing-tables#testing-that-a-column-can-be-sorted), you can use the `sortTable()` method to sort the table by a specific column. You can also use the `assertCanSeeTableRecords()` method to check if the records are being displayed in the correct order:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\ListUsers;
use App\Models\User;

it('can sort users by `name`', function () {
    $users = User::factory()->count(5)->create();

    livewire(ListUsers::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
        ->sortTable('name')
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->sortBy('name'), inOrder: true)
        ->sortTable('name', 'desc')
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->sortByDesc('name'), inOrder: true);
});
```

To [test that the table filtering is working](testing-tables#testing-filters), you can use the `filterTable()` method to filter the table by a specific column. You can also use the `assertCanSeeTableRecords()` and `assertCanNotSeeTableRecords()` methods to check if the correct records are being displayed in the table:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\ListUsers;
use App\Models\User;

it('can filter users by `locale`', function () {
    $users = User::factory()->count(5)->create();

    livewire(ListUsers::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
        ->filterTable('locale', $users->first()->locale)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->where('locale', $users->first()->locale))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->where('locale', '!=', $users->first()->locale));
});
```

To [test that the table bulk actions are working](testing-actions#testing-table-bulk-actions), you can use the `selectTableRecords()` method to select multiple records in the table. You can also use the `callAction()` method to call a specific action on the selected records:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\ListUsers;
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;
use function Pest\Laravel\assertDatabaseMissing;

it('can bulk delete users', function () {
    $users = User::factory()->count(5)->create();

    livewire(ListUsers::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
        ->selectTableRecords($users)
        ->callAction(TestAction::make(DeleteBulkAction::class)->table()->bulk())
        ->assertNotified()
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users);

    $users->each(fn (User $user) => assertDatabaseMissing($user));
});
```

## Testing a resource create page

To test if the create page is able to load, test the create page as a Livewire component, and call `assertOk()` to ensure that the HTTP response was 200 OK:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\CreateUser;
use App\Models\User;

it('can load the page', function () {
    livewire(CreateUser::class)
        ->assertOk();
});
```

To test the form on the create page, you should visit the [Testing schemas](testing-schemas) section. To test any actions in the header of the page or in the form, you should visit the [Testing actions](testing-actions) section. Below are some common examples of other tests that you can run on the create page.

To test that the form is creating records correctly, you can use the `fillForm()` method to fill in the form fields, and then use the `call('create')` method to create the record. You can also use the `assertNotified()` method to check if a notification was displayed, and the `assertRedirect()` method to check if the user was redirected to another page:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\CreateUser;
use App\Models\User;
use function Pest\Laravel\assertDatabaseHas;

it('can create a user', function () {
    $newUserData = User::factory()->make();

    livewire(CreateUser::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'name' => $newUserData->name,
            'email' => $newUserData->email,
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertNotified()
        ->assertRedirect();

    assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
        'name' => $newUserData->name,
        'email' => $newUserData->email,
    ]);
});
```

To test that the form is validating properly, you can use the `fillForm()` method to fill in the form fields, and then use the `call('create')` method to create the record. You can also use the `assertHasFormErrors()` method to check if the form has any errors, and the `assertNotNotified()` method to check if no notification was displayed. You can also use the `assertNoRedirect()` method to check if the user was not redirected to another page. In this example, we use a [Pest dataset](https://pestphp.com/docs/datasets#content-bound-datasets) to test multiple rules without having to repeat the test code:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\CreateUser;
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

it('validates the form data', function (array $data, array $errors) {
    $newUserData = User::factory()->make();

    livewire(CreateUser::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'name' => $newUserData->name,
            'email' => $newUserData->email,
            ...$data,
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertHasFormErrors($errors)
        ->assertNotNotified()
        ->assertNoRedirect();
})->with([
    '`name` is required' => [['name' => null], ['name' => 'required']],
    '`name` is max 255 characters' => [['name' => Str::random(256)], ['name' => 'max']],
    '`email` is a valid email address' => [['email' => Str::random()], ['email' => 'email']],
    '`email` is required' => [['email' => null], ['email' => 'required']],
    '`email` is max 255 characters' => [['email' => Str::random(256)], ['email' => 'max']],
]);
```

## Testing a resource edit page

To test if the edit page is able to load, test the edit page as a Livewire component, and call `assertOk()` to ensure that the HTTP response was 200 OK. You can also use the `assertSchemaStateSet()` method to check if the form fields are set to the correct values:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\EditUser;
use App\Models\User;

it('can load the page', function () {
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditUser::class, [
        'record' => $user->id,
    ])
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertSchemaStateSet([
            'name' => $user->name,
            'email' => $user->email,
        ]);
});
```

To test the form on the edit page, you should visit the [Testing schemas](testing-schemas) section. To test any actions in the header of the page or in the form, you should visit the [Testing actions](testing-actions) section. Below are some common examples of other tests that you can run on the edit page.

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\EditUser;
use App\Models\User;
use function Pest\Laravel\assertDatabaseHas;

it('can update a user', function () {
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    $newUserData = User::factory()->make();

    livewire(EditUser::class, [
        'record' => $user->id,
    ])
        ->fillForm([
            'name' => $newUserData->name,
            'email' => $newUserData->email,
        ])
        ->call('save')
        ->assertNotified();

    assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
        'id' => $user->id,
        'name' => $newUserData->name,
        'email' => $newUserData->email,
    ]);
});
```

To test that the form is validating properly, you can use the `fillForm()` method to fill in the form fields, and then use the `call('save')` method to save the record. You can also use the `assertHasFormErrors()` method to check if the form has any errors, and the `assertNotNotified()` method to check if no notification was displayed. In this example, we use a [Pest dataset](https://pestphp.com/docs/datasets#content-bound-datasets) to test multiple rules without having to repeat the test code:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\EditUser;
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

it('validates the form data', function (array $data, array $errors) {
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    $newUserData = User::factory()->make();

    livewire(EditUser::class, [
        'record' => $user->id,
    ])
        ->fillForm([
            'name' => $newUserData->name,
            'email' => $newUserData->email,
            ...$data,
        ])
        ->call('save')
        ->assertHasFormErrors($errors)
        ->assertNotNotified();
})->with([
    '`name` is required' => [['name' => null], ['name' => 'required']],
    '`name` is max 255 characters' => [['name' => Str::random(256)], ['name' => 'max']],
    '`email` is a valid email address' => [['email' => Str::random()], ['email' => 'email']],
    '`email` is required' => [['email' => null], ['email' => 'required']],
    '`email` is max 255 characters' => [['email' => Str::random(256)], ['email' => 'max']],
]);
```

To [test that an action is working](testing-actions), such as the `DeleteAction`, you can use the `callAction()` method to call the delete action. You can also use the `assertNotified()` method to check if a notification was displayed, and the `assertRedirect()` method to check if the user was redirected to another page:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\EditUser;
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
use function Pest\Laravel\assertDatabaseMissing;

it('can delete a user', function () {
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditUser::class, [
        'record' => $user->id,
    ])
        ->callAction(DeleteAction::class)
        ->assertNotified()
        ->assertRedirect();

    assertDatabaseMissing($user);
});
```

## Testing a resource view page

To test if the view page is able to load, test the view page as a Livewire component, and call `assertOk()` to ensure that the HTTP response was 200 OK. You can also use the `assertSchemaStateSet()` method to check if the infolist entries are set to the correct values:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\ViewUser;
use App\Models\User;

it('can load the page', function () {
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    livewire(ViewUser::class, [
        'record' => $user->id,
    ])
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertSchemaStateSet([
            'name' => $user->name,
            'email' => $user->email,
        ]);
});
```

To test the infolist on the view page, you should visit the [Testing schemas](testing-schemas) section. To test any actions in the header of the page or in the infolist, you should visit the [Testing actions](testing-actions) section.

## Testing relation managers

To test if a relation manager is rendered on a page, such as the edit page of a resource, you can use the `assertSeeLivewire()` method to check if the relation manager is being rendered:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\EditUser;
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\RelationManagers\PostsRelationManager;
use App\Models\User;

it('can load the relation manager', function () {
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditUser::class, [
        'record' => $user->id,
    ])
        ->assertSeeLivewire(PostsRelationManager::class);
});
```

Since relation managers are Livewire components, you can also test a relation manager's functionality itself, like its ability to load successfully with a 200 OK response, with the correct records in the table. When testing a relation manager, you need to pass in the `ownerRecord`, which is the record from the resource you are inside, and the `pageClass`, which is the class of the page you are on:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\EditUser;
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\RelationManagers\PostsRelationManager;
use App\Models\Post;
use App\Models\User;

it('can load the relation manager', function () {
    $user = User::factory()
        ->has(Post::factory()->count(5))
        ->create();

    livewire(PostsRelationManager::class, [
        'ownerRecord' => $user,
        'pageClass' => EditUser::class,
    ])
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($user->posts);
});
```

You can [test searching](testing-tables#testing-that-a-column-can-be-searched), [sorting](testing-tables#testing-that-a-column-can-be-sorted), and [filtering](testing-tables#testing-filters) in the same way as you would on a resource list page.

You can also [test actions](testing-actions), for example, the `CreateAction` in the header of the table:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\Pages\EditUser;
use App\Filament\Resources\Users\RelationManagers\PostsRelationManager;
use App\Models\Post;
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;
use function Pest\Laravel\assertDatabaseHas;

it('can create a post', function () {
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    $newPostData = Post::factory()->make();

    livewire(PostsRelationManager::class, [
        'ownerRecord' => $user,
        'pageClass' => EditUser::class,
    ])
        ->callAction(TestAction::make(CreateAction::class)->table(), [
            'title' => $newPostData->title,
            'content' => $newPostData->content,
        ])
        ->assertNotified();

    assertDatabaseHas(Post::class, [
        'title' => $newPostData->title,
        'content' => $newPostData->content,
        'user_id' => $user->id,
    ]);
});
```

## Testing multiple panels

If you have multiple panels and you would like to test a non-default panel, you will need to tell Filament which panel you are testing. This can be done in the `setUp()` method of the test case, or you can do it at the start of a particular test. Filament usually does this in a middleware when you access the panel through a request, so if you're not making a request in your test like when testing a Livewire component, you need to set the current panel manually:

```php
use Filament\Facades\Filament;

Filament::setCurrentPanel('app'); // Where `app` is the ID of the panel you want to test.
```

## Testing that a table can render

To ensure a table component renders, use the `assertSuccessful()` Livewire helper:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can render page', function () {
    livewire(ListPosts::class)
        ->assertSuccessful();
});
```

To test which records are shown, you can use `assertCanSeeTableRecords()`, `assertCanNotSeeTableRecords()` and `assertCountTableRecords()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('cannot display trashed posts by default', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(4)->create();
    $trashedPosts = Post::factory()->trashed()->count(6)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts)
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($trashedPosts)
        ->assertCountTableRecords(4);
});
```

> If your table uses pagination, `assertCanSeeTableRecords()` will only check for records on the first page. To switch page, call `call('gotoPage', 2)`.

> If your table uses `deferLoading()`, you should call `loadTable()` before `assertCanSeeTableRecords()`.

## Testing columns

To ensure that a certain column is rendered, pass the column name to `assertCanRenderTableColumn()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can render post titles', function () {
    Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanRenderTableColumn('title');
});
```

This helper will get the HTML for this column, and check that it is present in the table.

For testing that a column is not rendered, you can use `assertCanNotRenderTableColumn()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can not render post comments', function () {
    Post::factory()->count(10)->create()

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanNotRenderTableColumn('comments');
});
```

This helper will assert that the HTML for this column is not shown by default in the present table.

### Testing that a column can be searched

To search the table, call the `searchTable()` method with your search query.

You can then use `assertCanSeeTableRecords()` to check your filtered table records, and use `assertCanNotSeeTableRecords()` to assert that some records are no longer in the table:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can search posts by title', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    $title = $posts->first()->title;

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->searchTable($title)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts->where('title', $title))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($posts->where('title', '!=', $title));
});
```

To search individual columns, you can pass an array of searches to `searchTableColumns()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can search posts by title column', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    $title = $posts->first()->title;

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->searchTableColumns(['title' => $title])
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts->where('title', $title))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($posts->where('title', '!=', $title));
});
```

### Testing that a column can be sorted

To sort table records, you can call `sortTable()`, passing the name of the column to sort by. You can use `'desc'` in the second parameter of `sortTable()` to reverse the sorting direction.

Once the table is sorted, you can ensure that the table records are rendered in order using `assertCanSeeTableRecords()` with the `inOrder` parameter:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can sort posts by title', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->sortTable('title')
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts->sortBy('title'), inOrder: true)
        ->sortTable('title', 'desc')
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts->sortByDesc('title'), inOrder: true);
});
```

### Testing the state of a column

To assert that a certain column has a state or does not have a state for a record you can use `assertTableColumnStateSet()` and `assertTableColumnStateNotSet()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can get post author names', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    $post = $posts->first();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableColumnStateSet('author.name', $post->author->name, record: $post)
        ->assertTableColumnStateNotSet('author.name', 'Anonymous', record: $post);
});
```

To assert that a certain column has a formatted state or does not have a formatted state for a record you can use `assertTableColumnFormattedStateSet()` and `assertTableColumnFormattedStateNotSet()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can get post author names', function () {
    $post = Post::factory(['name' => 'John Smith'])->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableColumnFormattedStateSet('author.name', 'Smith, John', record: $post)
        ->assertTableColumnFormattedStateNotSet('author.name', $post->author->name, record: $post);
});
```

### Testing the existence of a column

To ensure that a column exists, you can use the `assertTableColumnExists()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has an author column', function () {
    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableColumnExists('author');
});
```

You may pass a function as an additional argument to assert that a column passes a given "truth test". This is useful for asserting that a column has a specific configuration. You can also pass in a record as the third parameter, which is useful if your check is dependant on which table row is being rendered:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

it('has an author column', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();
    
    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableColumnExists('author', function (TextColumn $column): bool {
            return $column->getDescriptionBelow() === $post->subtitle;
        }, $post);
});
```

### Testing the visibility of a column

To ensure that a particular user cannot see a column, you can use the `assertTableColumnVisible()` and `assertTableColumnHidden()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('shows the correct columns', function () {
    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableColumnVisible('created_at')
        ->assertTableColumnHidden('author');
});
```

### Testing the description of a column

To ensure a column has the correct description above or below you can use the `assertTableColumnHasDescription()` and `assertTableColumnDoesNotHaveDescription()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has the correct descriptions above and below author', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostsTable::class)
        ->assertTableColumnHasDescription('author', 'Author! ↓↓↓', $post, 'above')
        ->assertTableColumnHasDescription('author', 'Author! ↑↑↑', $post)
        ->assertTableColumnDoesNotHaveDescription('author', 'Author! ↑↑↑', $post, 'above')
        ->assertTableColumnDoesNotHaveDescription('author', 'Author! ↓↓↓', $post);
});
```

### Testing the extra attributes of a column

To ensure that a column has the correct extra attributes, you can use the `assertTableColumnHasExtraAttributes()` and `assertTableColumnDoesNotHaveExtraAttributes()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('displays author in red', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostsTable::class)
        ->assertTableColumnHasExtraAttributes('author', ['class' => 'text-danger-500'], $post)
        ->assertTableColumnDoesNotHaveExtraAttributes('author', ['class' => 'text-primary-500'], $post);
});
```

### Testing the options in a `SelectColumn`

If you have a select column, you can ensure it has the correct options with `assertTableSelectColumnHasOptions()` and `assertTableSelectColumnDoesNotHaveOptions()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has the correct statuses', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostsTable::class)
        ->assertTableSelectColumnHasOptions('status', ['unpublished' => 'Unpublished', 'published' => 'Published'], $post)
        ->assertTableSelectColumnDoesNotHaveOptions('status', ['archived' => 'Archived'], $post);
});
```

## Testing filters

To filter the table records, you can use the `filterTable()` method, along with `assertCanSeeTableRecords()` and `assertCanNotSeeTableRecords()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can filter posts by `is_published`', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts)
        ->filterTable('is_published')
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts->where('is_published', true))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($posts->where('is_published', false));
});
```

For a simple filter, this will just enable the filter.

If you'd like to set the value of a `SelectFilter` or `TernaryFilter`, pass the value as a second argument:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can filter posts by `author_id`', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    $authorId = $posts->first()->author_id;

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts)
        ->filterTable('author_id', $authorId)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts->where('author_id', $authorId))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($posts->where('author_id', '!=', $authorId));
});
```

### Resetting filters in a test

To reset all filters to their original state, call `resetTableFilters()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can reset table filters', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->resetTableFilters();
});
```

### Removing filters in a test

To remove a single filter you can use `removeTableFilter()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('filters list by published', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    $unpublishedPosts = $posts->where('is_published', false)->get();

    livewire(PostsTable::class)
        ->filterTable('is_published')
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($unpublishedPosts)
        ->removeTableFilter('is_published')
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts);
});
```

To remove all filters you can use `removeTableFilters()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can remove all table filters', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->forAuthor()->create();

    $unpublishedPosts = $posts
        ->where('is_published', false)
        ->where('author_id', $posts->first()->author->getKey());

    livewire(PostsTable::class)
        ->filterTable('is_published')
        ->filterTable('author', $author)
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($unpublishedPosts)
        ->removeTableFilters()
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts);
});
```

### Testing the visibility of a filter

To ensure that a particular user cannot see a filter, you can use the `assertTableFilterVisible()` and `assertTableFilterHidden()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('shows the correct filters', function () {
    livewire(PostsTable::class)
        ->assertTableFilterVisible('created_at')
        ->assertTableFilterHidden('author');
```

### Testing the existence of a filter

To ensure that a filter exists, you can use the `assertTableFilterExists()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has an author filter', function () {
    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableFilterExists('author');
});
```

You may pass a function as an additional argument to assert that a filter passes a given "truth test". This is useful for asserting that a filter has a specific configuration:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

it('has an author filter', function () {    
    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableFilterExists('author', function (SelectFilter $column): bool {
            return $column->getLabel() === 'Select author';
        });
});
```

## Testing summaries

To test that a summary calculation is working, you may use the `assertTableColumnSummarySet()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can average values in a column', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts)
        ->assertTableColumnSummarySet('rating', 'average', $posts->avg('rating'));
});
```

The first argument is the column name, the second is the summarizer ID, and the third is the expected value.

Note that the expected and actual values are normalized, such that `123.12` is considered the same as `"123.12"`, and `['Fred', 'Jim']` is the same as `['Jim', 'Fred']`.

You may set a summarizer ID by passing it to the `make()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->summarize(Average::make('average'))
```

The ID should be unique between summarizers in that column.

### Testing summaries on only one pagination page

To calculate the average for only one pagination page, use the `isCurrentPaginationPageOnly` argument:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can average values in a column', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(20)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts->take(10))
        ->assertTableColumnSummarySet('rating', 'average', $posts->take(10)->avg('rating'), isCurrentPaginationPageOnly: true);
});
```

### Testing a range summarizer

To test a range, pass the minimum and maximum value into a tuple-style `[$minimum, $maximum]` array:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can average values in a column', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts)
        ->assertTableColumnSummarySet('rating', 'range', [$posts->min('rating'), $posts->max('rating')]);
});
```

## Filling a form in a test

To fill a form with data, pass the data to `fillForm()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(CreatePost::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'title' => fake()->sentence(),
        // ...
    ]);
```

> If you have multiple schemas on a Livewire component, you can specify which form you want to fill using `fillForm([...], 'createPostForm')`.

## Testing form field and infolist entry state

To check that a form has data, use `assertSchemaStateSet()`:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can automatically generate a slug from the title', function () {
    $title = fake()->sentence();

    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'title' => $title,
        ])
        ->assertSchemaStateSet([
            'slug' => Str::slug($title),
        ]);
});
```

> If you have multiple schemas on a Livewire component, you can specify which schema you want to check using `assertSchemaStateSet([...], 'createPostForm')`.

You may also find it useful to pass a function to the `assertSchemaStateSet()` method, which allows you to access the form `$state` and perform additional assertions:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can automatically generate a slug from the title without any spaces', function () {
    $title = fake()->sentence();

    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'title' => $title,
        ])
        ->assertSchemaStateSet(function (array $state): array {
            expect($state['slug'])
                ->not->toContain(' ');
                
            return [
                'slug' => Str::slug($title),
            ];
        });
});
```

You can return an array from the function if you want Filament to continue to assert the schema state after the function has been run.

## Testing form validation

Use `assertHasFormErrors()` to ensure that data is properly validated in a form:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can validate input', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'title' => null,
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertHasFormErrors(['title' => 'required']);
});
```

And `assertHasNoFormErrors()` to ensure there are no validation errors:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(CreatePost::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'title' => fake()->sentence(),
        // ...
    ])
    ->call('create')
    ->assertHasNoFormErrors();
```

> If you have multiple schemas on a Livewire component, you can pass the name of a specific form as the second parameter like `assertHasFormErrors(['title' => 'required'], 'createPostForm')` or `assertHasNoFormErrors([], 'createPostForm')`.

## Testing the existence of a form

To check that a Livewire component has a form, use `assertFormExists()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has a form', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormExists();
});
```

> If you have multiple schemas on a Livewire component, you can pass the name of a specific form like `assertFormExists('createPostForm')`.

## Testing the existence of form fields

To ensure that a form has a given field, pass the field name to `assertFormFieldExists()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has a title field', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormFieldExists('title');
});
```

You may pass a function as an additional argument to assert that a field passes a given "truth test". This is useful for asserting that a field has a specific configuration:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has a title field', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormFieldExists('title', function (TextInput $field): bool {
            return $field->isDisabled();
        });
});
```

To assert that a form does not have a given field, pass the field name to `assertFormFieldDoesNotExist()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('does not have a conditional field', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormFieldDoesNotExist('no-such-field');
});
```

> If you have multiple schemas on a Livewire component, you can specify which form you want to check for the existence of the field like `assertFormFieldExists('title', 'createPostForm')`.

## Testing the visibility of form fields

To ensure that a field is visible, pass the name to `assertFormFieldVisible()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

test('title is visible', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormFieldVisible('title');
});
```

Or to ensure that a field is hidden you can pass the name to `assertFormFieldHidden()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

test('title is hidden', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormFieldHidden('title');
});
```

> For both `assertFormFieldHidden()` and `assertFormFieldVisible()` you can pass the name of a specific form the field belongs to as the second argument like `assertFormFieldHidden('title', 'createPostForm')`.

## Testing disabled form fields

To ensure that a field is enabled, pass the name to `assertFormFieldEnabled()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

test('title is enabled', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormFieldEnabled('title');
});
```

Or to ensure that a field is disabled you can pass the name to `assertFormFieldDisabled()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

test('title is disabled', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormFieldDisabled('title');
});
```

> For both `assertFormFieldEnabled()` and `assertFormFieldDisabled()` you can pass the name of a specific form the field belongs to as the second argument like `assertFormFieldEnabled('title', 'createPostForm')`.

## Testing other schema components

If you need to check if a particular schema component exists rather than a field, you may use `assertSchemaComponentExists()`.  As components do not have names, this method uses the `key()` provided by the developer:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Comments')
    ->key('comments-section')
    ->schema([
        //
    ])
```

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

test('comments section exists', function () {
    livewire(EditPost::class)
        ->assertSchemaComponentExists('comments-section');
});
```

To assert that a schema does not have a given component, pass the component key to `assertSchemaComponentDoesNotExist()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('does not have a conditional component', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertSchemaComponentDoesNotExist('no-such-section');
});
```

To check if the component exists and passes a given truth test, you can pass a function to the second argument of `assertSchemaComponentExists()`, returning true or false if the component passes the test or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Component;

use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

test('comments section has heading', function () {
    livewire(EditPost::class)
        ->assertSchemaComponentExists(
            'comments-section',
            function (Component $component): bool {
                return $component->getHeading() === 'Comments';
            },
        );
});
```

If you want more informative test results, you can embed an assertion within your truth test callback:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Component;
use Illuminate\Testing\Assert;

use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

test('comments section is enabled', function () {
    livewire(EditPost::class)
        ->assertSchemaComponentExists(
            'comments-section',
            function (Component $component): bool {
                Assert::assertTrue(
                    $component->isEnabled(),
                    'Failed asserting that comments-section is enabled.',
                );
                
                return true;
            },
        );
});
```

## Testing repeaters

Internally, repeaters generate UUIDs for items to keep track of them in the Livewire HTML easier. This means that when you are testing a form with a repeater, you need to ensure that the UUIDs are consistent between the form and the test. This can be tricky, and if you don't do it correctly, your tests can fail as the tests are expecting a UUID, not a numeric key.

However, since Livewire doesn't need to keep track of the UUIDs in a test, you can disable the UUID generation and replace them with numeric keys, using the `Repeater::fake()` method at the start of your test:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$undoRepeaterFake = Repeater::fake();

livewire(EditPost::class, ['record' => $post])
    ->assertSchemaStateSet([
        'quotes' => [
            [
                'content' => 'First quote',
            ],
            [
                'content' => 'Second quote',
            ],
        ],
        // ...
    ]);

$undoRepeaterFake();
```

You may also find it useful to test the number of items in a repeater by passing a function to the `assertSchemaStateSet()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$undoRepeaterFake = Repeater::fake();

livewire(EditPost::class, ['record' => $post])
    ->assertSchemaStateSet(function (array $state) {
        expect($state['quotes'])
            ->toHaveCount(2);
    });

$undoRepeaterFake();
```

### Testing repeater actions

In order to test that repeater actions are working as expected, you can utilize the `callFormComponentAction()` method to call your repeater actions and then [perform additional assertions](../testing#actions).

To interact with an action on a particular repeater item, you need to pass in the `item` argument with the key of that repeater item. If your repeater is reading from a relationship, you should prefix the ID (key) of the related record with `record-` to form the key of the repeater item:

```php
use App\Models\Quote;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$quote = Quote::first();

livewire(EditPost::class, ['record' => $post])
    ->callAction(TestAction::make('sendQuote')->schemaComponent('quotes')->arguments([
        'item' => "record-{$quote->getKey()}",
    ]))
    ->assertNotified('Quote sent!');
```

## Testing builders

Internally, builders generate UUIDs for items to keep track of them in the Livewire HTML easier. This means that when you are testing a form with a builder, you need to ensure that the UUIDs are consistent between the form and the test. This can be tricky, and if you don't do it correctly, your tests can fail as the tests are expecting a UUID, not a numeric key.

However, since Livewire doesn't need to keep track of the UUIDs in a test, you can disable the UUID generation and replace them with numeric keys, using the `Builder::fake()` method at the start of your test:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$undoBuilderFake = Builder::fake();

livewire(EditPost::class, ['record' => $post])
    ->assertSchemaStateSet([
        'content' => [
            [
                'type' => 'heading',
                'data' => [
                    'content' => 'Hello, world!',
                    'level' => 'h1',
                ],
            ],
            [
                'type' => 'paragraph',
                'data' => [
                    'content' => 'This is a test post.',
                ],
            ],
        ],
        // ...
    ]);

$undoBuilderFake();
```

You may also find it useful to access test the number of items in a repeater by passing a function to the `assertSchemaStateSet()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$undoBuilderFake = Builder::fake();

livewire(EditPost::class, ['record' => $post])
    ->assertSchemaStateSet(function (array $state) {
        expect($state['content'])
            ->toHaveCount(2);
    });

$undoBuilderFake();
```

## Testing wizards

To go to a wizard's next step, use `goToNextWizardStep()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('moves to next wizard step', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->goToNextWizardStep()
        ->assertHasFormErrors(['title']);
});
```

You can also go to the previous step by calling `goToPreviousWizardStep()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('moves to next wizard step', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->goToPreviousWizardStep()
        ->assertHasFormErrors(['title']);
});
```

If you want to go to a specific step, use `goToWizardStep()`, then the `assertWizardCurrentStep` method which can ensure you are on the desired step without validation errors from the previous:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('moves to the wizards second step', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->goToWizardStep(2)
        ->assertWizardCurrentStep(2);
});
```

If you have multiple schemas on a single Livewire component, any of the wizard test helpers can accept a `schema` parameter:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('moves to next wizard step only for fooForm', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->goToNextWizardStep(schema: 'fooForm')
        ->assertHasFormErrors(['title'], schema: 'fooForm');
});
```

## Calling an action in a test

You can call an action by passing its name or class to `callAction()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callAction('send');

    expect($invoice->refresh())
        ->isSent()->toBeTrue();
});
```

## Testing table actions

To test table actions, you can use a `TestAction` object with the `table()` method. This object receives the name of the action you want to test, and replaces the name of the action in any testing method you want to use. For example:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

livewire(ListInvoices::class)
    ->callAction(TestAction::make('send')->table($invoice));

livewire(ListInvoices::class)
    ->assertActionVisible(TestAction::make('send')->table($invoice))

livewire(ListInvoices::class)
    ->assertActionExists(TestAction::make('send')->table($invoice))
```

### Testing table header actions

To test a header action, you can use the `table()` method without passing in a specific record to test with:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(ListInvoices::class)
    ->callAction(TestAction::make('create')->table());

livewire(ListInvoices::class)
    ->assertActionVisible(TestAction::make('create')->table())

livewire(ListInvoices::class)
    ->assertActionExists(TestAction::make('create')->table())
```

### Testing table bulk actions

To test a bulk action, first call `selectTableRecords()` and pass in any records you want to select. Then, use the `TestAction`'s `bulk()` method to specify the action you want to test. For example:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$invoices = Invoice::factory()->count(3)->create();

livewire(ListInvoices::class)
    ->selectTableRecords($invoices->pluck('id')->toArray())
    ->callAction(TestAction::make('send')->table()->bulk());

livewire(ListInvoices::class)
    ->assertActionVisible(TestAction::make('send')->table()->bulk())

livewire(ListInvoices::class)
    ->assertActionExists(TestAction::make('send')->table()->bulk())
```

## Testing actions in a schema

If an action belongs to a component in a resource's infolist, for example, if it is in the `belowContent()` method of an infolist entry, you can use the `TestAction` object with the `schemaComponent()` method. This object receives the name of the action you want to test and replaces the name of the action in any testing method you want to use. For example:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

livewire(EditInvoice::class)
    ->callAction(TestAction::make('send')->schemaComponent('customer_id'));

livewire(EditInvoice::class)
    ->assertActionVisible(TestAction::make('send')->schemaComponent('customer_id'))

livewire(EditInvoice::class)
    ->assertActionExists(TestAction::make('send')->schemaComponent('customer_id'))
```

## Testing actions inside another action's schema / form

If an action belongs to a component in another action's `schema()` (or `form()`), for example, if it is in the `belowContent()` method of a form field in an action modal, you can use the `TestAction` object with the `schemaComponent()` method. This object receives the name of the action you want to test and replaces the name of the action in any testing method you want to use. You should pass an array of `TestAction` objects in order, for example:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

livewire(ManageInvoices::class)
    ->callAction([
        TestAction::make('view')->table($invoice),
        TestAction::make('send')->schemaComponent('customer.name'),
    ]);
    
livewire(ManageInvoices::class)
    ->assertActionVisible([
        TestAction::make('view')->table($invoice),
        TestAction::make('send')->schemaComponent('customer.name'),
    ]);
    
livewire(ManageInvoices::class)
    ->assertActionExists([
        TestAction::make('view')->table($invoice),
        TestAction::make('send')->schemaComponent('customer.name'),
    ]);
```

## Testing forms in action modals

To pass an array of data into an action, use the `data` parameter:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callAction('send', data: [
            'email' => $email = fake()->email(),
        ])
        ->assertHasNoFormErrors();

    expect($invoice->refresh())
        ->isSent()->toBeTrue()
        ->recipient_email->toBe($email);
});
```

If you ever need to only set an action's data without immediately calling it, you can use `fillForm()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->mountAction('send')
        ->fillForm([
            'email' => $email = fake()->email(),
        ])
});
```

### Testing validation errors in an action modal's form

`assertHasNoFormErrors()` is used to assert that no validation errors occurred when submitting the action form.

To check if a validation error has occurred with the data, use `assertHasFormErrors()`, similar to `assertHasErrors()` in Livewire:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can validate invoice recipient email', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callAction('send', data: [
            'email' => Str::random(),
        ])
        ->assertHasFormErrors(['email' => ['email']]);
});
```

To check if an action is pre-filled with data, you can use the `assertSchemaStateSet()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices to the primary contact by default', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();
    $recipientEmail = $invoice->company->primaryContact->email;

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->mountAction('send')
        ->assertSchemaStateSet([
            'email' => $recipientEmail,
        ])
        ->callMountedAction()
        ->assertHasNoFormErrors();

    expect($invoice->refresh())
        ->isSent()->toBeTrue()
        ->recipient_email->toBe($recipientEmail);
});
```

## Testing the content of an action modal

To assert the content of a modal, you should first mount the action (rather than call it which closes the modal). You can then use [Livewire assertions](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/testing#assertions) such as `assertSee()` to assert the modal contains the content that you expect it to:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('confirms the target address before sending', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();
    $recipientEmail = $invoice->company->primaryContact->email;

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->mountAction('send')
        ->assertSee($recipientEmail);
});
```

## Testing the existence of an action

To ensure that an action exists or doesn't, you can use the `assertActionExists()` or  `assertActionDoesNotExist()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send but not unsend invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionExists('send')
        ->assertActionDoesNotExist('unsend');
});
```

You may pass a function as an additional argument to assert that an action passes a given "truth test". This is useful for asserting that an action has a specific configuration:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has the correct description', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionExists('send', function (Action $action): bool {
            return $action->getModalDescription() === 'This will send an email to the customer\'s primary address, with the invoice attached as a PDF';
        });
});
```

## Testing the visibility of an action

To ensure an action is hidden or visible for a user, you can use the `assertActionHidden()` or `assertActionVisible()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can only print invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionHidden('send')
        ->assertActionVisible('print');
});
```

## Testing disabled actions

To ensure an action is enabled or disabled for a user, you can use the `assertActionEnabled()` or `assertActionDisabled()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can only print a sent invoice', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionDisabled('send')
        ->assertActionEnabled('print');
});
```

To ensure sets of actions exist in the correct order, you can use `assertActionsExistInOrder()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can have actions in order', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionsExistInOrder(['send', 'export']);
});
```

To check if an action is hidden to a user, you can use the `assertActionHidden()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can not send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionHidden('send');
});
```

## Testing the label of an action

To ensure an action has the correct label, you can use `assertActionHasLabel()` and `assertActionDoesNotHaveLabel()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('send action has correct label', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionHasLabel('send', 'Email Invoice')
        ->assertActionDoesNotHaveLabel('send', 'Send');
});
```

## Testing the icon of an action

To ensure an action's button is showing the correct icon, you can use `assertActionHasIcon()` or `assertActionDoesNotHaveIcon()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('when enabled the send button has correct icon', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionEnabled('send')
        ->assertActionHasIcon('send', 'envelope-open')
        ->assertActionDoesNotHaveIcon('send', 'envelope');
});
```

## Testing the color of an action

To ensure that an action's button is displaying the right color, you can use `assertActionHasColor()` or `assertActionDoesNotHaveColor()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('actions display proper colors', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionHasColor('delete', 'danger')
        ->assertActionDoesNotHaveColor('print', 'danger');
});
```

## Testing the URL of an action

To ensure an action has the correct URL, you can use `assertActionHasUrl()`, `assertActionDoesNotHaveUrl()`, `assertActionShouldOpenUrlInNewTab()`, and `assertActionShouldNotOpenUrlInNewTab()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('links to the correct Filament sites', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionHasUrl('filament', 'https://filamentphp.com/')
        ->assertActionDoesNotHaveUrl('filament', 'https://github.com/filamentphp/filament')
        ->assertActionShouldOpenUrlInNewTab('filament')
        ->assertActionShouldNotOpenUrlInNewTab('github');
});
```

## Testing action arguments

To test action arguments, you can use a `TestAction` object with the `arguments()` method. This object receives the name of the action you want to test and replaces the name of the action in any testing method you want to use. For example:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

livewire(ManageInvoices::class)
    ->callAction(TestAction::make('send')->arguments(['invoice' => $invoice->getKey()]));

livewire(ManageInvoices::class)
    ->assertActionVisible(TestAction::make('send')->arguments(['invoice' => $invoice->getKey()]))

livewire(ManageInvoices::class)
    ->assertActionExists(TestAction::make('send')->arguments(['invoice' => $invoice->getKey()]))
```

## Testing if an action has been halted

To check if an action has been halted, you can use `assertActionHalted()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('stops sending if invoice has no email address', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory(['email' => null])->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callAction('send')
        ->assertActionHalted('send');
});
```

## Using action class names in tests

Filament includes a host of prebuilt actions such as `CreateAction`, `EditAction` and `DeleteAction`, and you can use these class names in your tests instead of action names, for example:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(ManageInvoices::class)
    ->callAction(CreateAction::class)
```

If you have your own action classes in your app with a `make()` method, the name of your action is not discoverable by Filament unless it runs the `make()` method, which is not efficient. To use your own action class names in your tests, you can add an `#[ActionName]` attribute to your action class, which Filament can use to discover the name of your action. The name passed to the `#[ActionName]` attribute should be the same as the name of the action you would normally use in your tests. For example:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Actions\ActionName;

#[ActionName('send')]
class SendInvoiceAction
{
    public static function make(): Action
    {
        return Action::make('send')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(function () {
                // ...
            });
    }
}
```

Now, you can use the class name in your tests:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Invoices\Actions\SendInvoiceAction;
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

livewire(ManageInvoices::class)
    ->callAction(TestAction::make(SendInvoiceAction::class)->table($invoice);
```

If you have an action class that extends the `Action` class, you can add a `getDefaultName()` static method to the class, which will be used to discover the name of the action. It also allows users to omit the name of the action from the `make()` method when instantiating it. For example:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

class SendInvoiceAction extends Action
{
    public static function getDefaultName(): string
    {
        return 'send';
    }

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        parent::setUp();
        
        $this
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(function () {
                // ...
            });
    }
}
```

title: Testing notifications

## Testing session notifications

To check if a notification was sent using the session, use the `assertNotified()` helper:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('sends a notification', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertNotified();
});
```

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

it('sends a notification', function () {
    Notification::assertNotified();
});
```

```php
use function Filament\Notifications\Testing\assertNotified;

it('sends a notification', function () {
    assertNotified();
});
```

You may optionally pass a notification title to test for:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('sends a notification', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertNotified('Unable to create post');
});
```

Or test if the exact notification was sent:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('sends a notification', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertNotified(
            Notification::make()
                ->danger()
                ->title('Unable to create post')
                ->body('Something went wrong.'),
        );
});
```

Conversely, you can assert that a notification was not sent:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('does not send a notification', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertNotNotified()
        // or
        ->assertNotNotified('Unable to create post')
        // or
        ->assertNotNotified(
            Notification::make()
                ->danger()
                ->title('Unable to create post')
                ->body('Something went wrong.'),
        );
```

## Introduction

While Filament comes with virtually any tool you'll need to build great apps, sometimes you'll need to add your own functionality either for just your app or as redistributable packages that other developers can include in their own apps. This is why Filament offers a plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality.

Before we dive in, it's important to understand the different contexts in which plugins can be used. There are two main contexts:

1. **Panel Plugins**: These are plugins that are used with [Panel Builders](../introduction/installation). They are typically used only to add functionality when used inside a Panel or as a complete Panel in and of itself. Examples of this are:
   1. A plugin that adds specific functionality to the dashboard in the form of Widgets.
   2. A plugin that adds a set of Resources / functionality to an app like a Blog or User Management feature.
2. **Standalone Plugins**: These are plugins that are used in any context outside a Panel Builder. Examples of this are:
   1. A plugin that adds custom fields to be used with the [Form Builders](../forms/installation/).
   2. A plugin that adds custom columns or filters to the [Table Builders](../tables/installation/).

Although these are two different mental contexts to keep in mind when building plugins, they can be used together inside the same plugin. They do not have to be mutually exclusive.

## Important concepts

Before we dive into the specifics of building plugins, there are a few concepts that are important to understand. You should familiarize yourself with the following before building a plugin:

1. [Laravel Package Development](https://laravel.com/docs/packages)
2. [Spatie Package Tools](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-package-tools)
3. [Filament Asset Management](../advanced/assets)

### The Plugin object

Filament introduces the concept of a Plugin object that is used to configure the plugin. This object is a simple PHP class that implements the `Filament\Contracts\Plugin` interface. This class is used to configure the plugin and is the main entry point for the plugin. It is also used to register Resources and Icons that might be used by your plugin.

While the plugin object is extremely helpful, it is not required to build a plugin. You can still build plugins without using the plugin object as you can see in the [building a panel plugin](building-a-panel-plugin) tutorial.

<Aside variant="info">
   The Plugin object is only used for Panel Providers. Standalone Plugins do not use this object. All configuration for Standalone Plugins should be handled in the plugin's service provider.
</Aside>

### Registering assets

All [asset registration](../advanced/assets), including CSS, JS and Alpine Components, should be done through the plugin's service provider in the `packageBooted()` method. This allows Filament to register the assets with the Asset Manager and load them when needed.

## Creating a plugin

While you can certainly build plugins from scratch, we recommend using the [Filament Plugin Skeleton](https://github.com/filamentphp/plugin-skeleton) to quickly get started. This skeleton includes all the necessary boilerplate to get you up and running quickly.

### Usage

To use the skeleton, simply go to the GitHub repo and click the "Use this template" button. This will create a new repo in your account with the skeleton code. After that, you can clone the repo to your machine. Once you have the code on your machine, navigate to the root of the project and run the following command:

```bash
php ./configure.php
```

This will ask you a series of questions to configure the plugin. Once you've answered all the questions, the script will stub out a new plugin for you, and you can begin to build your amazing new extension for Filament.

## Upgrading existing plugins

Since every plugin varies greatly in its scope of use and functionality, there is no one size fits all approaches to upgrading existing plugins. However, one thing to note, that is consistent to all plugins is the deprecation of the `PluginServiceProvider`.

In your plugin service provider, you will need to change it to extend the PackageServiceProvider instead. You will also need to add a static `$name` property to the service provider. This property is used to register the plugin with Filament. Here is an example of what your service provider might look like:

```php
class MyPluginServiceProvider extends PackageServiceProvider
{
    public static string $name = 'my-plugin';

    public function configurePackage(Package $package): void
    {
        $package->name(static::$name);
    }
}
```

## Introduction

The basis of Filament plugins are Laravel packages. They are installed into your Filament project via Composer, and follow all the standard techniques, like using service providers to register routes, views, and translations. If you're new to Laravel package development, here are some resources that can help you grasp the core concepts:

- [The Package Development section of the Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/packages) serves as a great reference guide.
- [Spatie's Package Training course](https://spatie.be/products/laravel-package-training) is a good instructional video series to teach you the process step by step.
- [Spatie's Package Tools](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-package-tools) allows you to simplify your service provider classes using a fluent configuration object.

Filament plugins build on top of the concepts of Laravel packages and allow you to ship and consume reusable features for any Filament panel. They can be added to each panel one at a time, and are also configurable differently per-panel.

## Configuring the panel with a plugin class

A plugin class is used to allow your package to interact with a panel [configuration](../panel-configuration) file. It's a simple PHP class that implements the `Plugin` interface. 3 methods are required:

- The `getId()` method returns the unique identifier of the plugin amongst other plugins. Please ensure that it is specific enough to not clash with other plugins that might be used in the same project.
- The `register()` method allows you to use any [configuration](../panel-configuration) option that is available to the panel. This includes registering [resources](resources), [custom pages](../navigation/custom-pages), [themes](themes), [render hooks](../panel-configuration#render-hooks) and more.
- The `boot()` method is run only when the panel that the plugin is being registered to is actually in-use. It is executed by a middleware class.

```php
<?php

namespace DanHarrin\FilamentBlog;

use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\Pages\Settings;
use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\Resources\CategoryResource;
use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\Resources\PostResource;
use Filament\Contracts\Plugin;
use Filament\Panel;

class BlogPlugin implements Plugin
{
    public function getId(): string
    {
        return 'blog';
    }

    public function register(Panel $panel): void
    {
        $panel
            ->resources([
                PostResource::class,
                CategoryResource::class,
            ])
            ->pages([
                Settings::class,
            ]);
    }

    public function boot(Panel $panel): void
    {
        //
    }
}
```

The users of your plugin can add it to a panel by instantiating the plugin class and passing it to the `plugin()` method of the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\BlogPlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->plugin(new BlogPlugin());
}
```

### Fluently instantiating the plugin class

You may want to add a `make()` method to your plugin class to provide a fluent interface for your users to instantiate it. In addition, by using the container (`app()`) to instantiate the plugin object, it can be replaced with a different implementation at runtime:

```php
use Filament\Contracts\Plugin;

class BlogPlugin implements Plugin
{
    public static function make(): static
    {
        return app(static::class);
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

Now, your users can use the `make()` method:

```php
use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\BlogPlugin;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->plugin(BlogPlugin::make());
}
```

### Configuring plugins per-panel

You may add other methods to your plugin class, which allow your users to configure it. We suggest that you add both a setter and a getter method for each option you provide. You should use a property to store the preference in the setter and retrieve it again in the getter:

```php
use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\Resources\AuthorResource;
use Filament\Contracts\Plugin;
use Filament\Panel;

class BlogPlugin implements Plugin
{
    protected bool $hasAuthorResource = false;
    
    public function authorResource(bool $condition = true): static
    {
        // This is the setter method, where the user's preference is
        // stored in a property on the plugin object.
        $this->hasAuthorResource = $condition;
    
        // The plugin object is returned from the setter method to
        // allow fluent chaining of configuration options.
        return $this;
    }
    
    public function hasAuthorResource(): bool
    {
        // This is the getter method, where the user's preference
        // is retrieved from the plugin property.
        return $this->hasAuthorResource;
    }
    
    public function register(Panel $panel): void
    {
        // Since the `register()` method is executed after the user
        // configures the plugin, you can access any of their
        // preferences inside it.
        if ($this->hasAuthorResource()) {
            // Here, we only register the author resource on the
            // panel if the user has requested it.
            $panel->resources([
                AuthorResource::class,
            ]);
        }
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

Additionally, you can use the unique ID of the plugin to access any of its configuration options from outside the plugin class. To do this, pass the ID to the `filament()` method:

```php
filament('blog')->hasAuthorResource()
```

You may wish to have better type safety and IDE autocompletion when accessing configuration. It's completely up to you how you choose to achieve this, but one idea could be adding a static method to the plugin class to retrieve it:

```php
use Filament\Contracts\Plugin;

class BlogPlugin implements Plugin
{
    public static function get(): static
    {
        return filament(app(static::class)->getId());
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

Now, you can access the plugin configuration using the new static method:

```php
BlogPlugin::get()->hasAuthorResource()
```

## Distributing a panel in a plugin

It's very easy to distribute an entire panel in a Laravel package. This way, a user can simply install your plugin and have an entirely new part of their app pre-built.

When [configuring](../panel-configuration) a panel, the configuration class extends the `PanelProvider` class, and that is a standard Laravel service provider. You can use it as a service provider in your package:

```php
<?php

namespace DanHarrin\FilamentBlog;

use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\PanelProvider;

class BlogPanelProvider extends PanelProvider
{
    public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
            ->id('blog')
            ->path('blog')
            ->resources([
                // ...
            ])
            ->pages([
                // ...
            ])
            ->widgets([
                // ...
            ])
            ->middleware([
                // ...
            ])
            ->authMiddleware([
                // ...
            ]);
    }
}
```

You should then register it as a service provider in the `composer.json` of your package:

```json
"extra": {
    "laravel": {
        "providers": [
            "DanHarrin\\FilamentBlog\\BlogPanelProvider"
        ]
    }
}
```

title: Build a panel plugin

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

## Preface

Please read the docs on [panel plugin development](../panels/plugins) and the [getting started guide](getting-started) before continuing.

## Introduction

In this walkthrough, we'll build a simple plugin that adds a new form field that can be used in forms. This also means it will be available to users in their panels.

You can find the final code for this plugin at [https://github.com/awcodes/clock-widget](https://github.com/awcodes/clock-widget).

## Step 1: Create the plugin

First, we'll create the plugin using the steps outlined in the [getting started guide](getting-started#creating-a-plugin).

## Step 2: Clean up

Next, we'll clean up the plugin to remove the boilerplate code we don't need. This will seem like a lot, but since this is a simple plugin, we can remove a lot of the boilerplate code.

Remove the following directories and files:
1. `config`
1. `database`
1. `src/Commands`
1. `src/Facades`
1. `stubs`

Since our plugin doesn't have any settings or additional methods needed for functionality, we can also remove the `ClockWidgetPlugin.php` file.

1. `ClockWidgetPlugin.php`

Since Filament recommends that users style their plugins with a custom filament theme, we'll remove the files needed for using CSS in the plugin. This is optional, and you can still use CSS if you want, but it is not recommended.

1. `resources/css`
2. `postcss.config.js`

Now we can clean up our `composer.json` file to remove unneeded options.

```json
"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
        // We can remove the database factories
        "Awcodes\\ClockWidget\\Database\\Factories\\": "database/factories/"
    }
},
"extra": {
    "laravel": {
        // We can remove the facade
        "aliases": {
            "ClockWidget": "Awcodes\\ClockWidget\\Facades\\ClockWidget"
        }
    }
},
```

The last step is to update the `package.json` file to remove unneeded options. Replace the contents of `package.json` with the following.

```json
{
    "private": true,
    "type": "module",
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "node bin/build.js --dev",
        "build": "node bin/build.js"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "esbuild": "^0.17.19"
    }
}
```

Then we need to install our dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

You may also remove the Testing directories and files, but we'll leave them in for now, although we won't be using them for this example, and we highly recommend that you write tests for your plugins.

## Step 3: Setting up the provider

Now that we have our plugin cleaned up, we can start adding our code. The boilerplate in the `src/ClockWidgetServiceProvider.php` file has a lot going on so, let's delete everything and start from scratch.

<Aside variant="info">
    In this example, we will be registering an [async Alpine component](../assets#asynchronous-alpinejs-components). Since these assets are only loaded on request, we can register them as normal in the `packageBooted()` method. If you are registering assets, like CSS or JS files, that get loaded on every page regardless of if they are used or not, you should register them in the `register()` method of the `Plugin` configuration object, using [`$panel->assets()`](../panel-configuration#registering-assets-for-a-panel). Otherwise, if you register them in the `packageBooted()` method, they will be loaded in every panel, regardless of whether or not the plugin has been registered for that panel.
</Aside>

We need to be able to register our Widget with the panel and load our Alpine component when the widget is used. To do this, we'll need to add the following to the `packageBooted` method in our service provider. This will register our widget component with Livewire and our Alpine component with the Filament Asset Manager.

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\AlpineComponent;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;
use Livewire\Livewire;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\Package;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\PackageServiceProvider;

class ClockWidgetServiceProvider extends PackageServiceProvider
{
    public static string $name = 'clock-widget';

    public function configurePackage(Package $package): void
    {
        $package->name(static::$name)
            ->hasViews()
            ->hasTranslations();
    }

    public function packageBooted(): void
    {
        Livewire::component('clock-widget', ClockWidget::class);

        // Asset Registration
        FilamentAsset::register(
            assets:[
                 AlpineComponent::make('clock-widget', __DIR__ . '/../resources/dist/clock-widget.js'),
            ],
            package: 'awcodes/clock-widget'
        );
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Create the widget

Now we can create our widget. We'll first need to extend Filament's `Widget` class in our `ClockWidget.php` file and tell it where to find the view for the widget. Since we are using the PackageServiceProvider to register our views, we can use the `::` syntax to tell Filament where to find the view.

```php
use Filament\Widgets\Widget;

class ClockWidget extends Widget
{
    protected static string $view = 'clock-widget::widget';
}
```

Next, we'll need to create the view for our widget. Create a new file at `resources/views/widget.blade.php` and add the following code. We'll make use of Filament's blade components to save time on writing the html for the widget.

We are using async Alpine to load our Alpine component, so we'll need to add the `x-load` attribute to the div to tell Alpine to load our component. You can learn more about this in the [Core Concepts](../advanced/assets#asynchronous-alpinejs-components) section of the docs.

```blade
<x-filament-widgets::widget>
    <x-filament::section>
        <x-slot name="heading">
            {{ __('clock-widget::clock-widget.title') }}
        </x-slot>

        <div
            x-load
            x-load-src="{{ \Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getAlpineComponentSrc('clock-widget', 'awcodes/clock-widget') }}"
            x-data="clockWidget()"
            class="text-center"
        >
            <p>{{ __('clock-widget::clock-widget.description') }}</p>
            <p class="text-xl" x-text="time"></p>
        </div>
    </x-filament::section>
</x-filament-widgets::widget>
```

Next, we need to write our Alpine component in `src/js/index.js`. And build our assets with `npm run build`.

```js
export default function clockWidget() {
    return {
        time: new Date().toLocaleTimeString(),
        init() {
            setInterval(() => {
                this.time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
            }, 1000);
        }
    }
}
```

We should also add translations for the text in the widget so users can translate the widget into their language. We'll add the translations to `resources/lang/en/widget.php`.

```php
return [
    'title' => 'Clock Widget',
    'description' => 'Your current time is:',
];
```

## Step 5: Update your README

You'll want to update your `README.md` file to include instructions on how to install your plugin and any other information you want to share with users, Like how to use it in their projects. For example:

```php
// Register the plugin and/or Widget in your Panel provider:

use Awcodes\ClockWidget\ClockWidgetWidget;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->widgets([
            ClockWidgetWidget::class,
        ]);
}
```

And, that's it, our users can now install our plugin and use it in their projects.

title: Build a standalone plugin
---

## Preface

Please read the docs on [panel plugin development](../panels/plugins/) and the [getting started guide](getting-started) before continuing.

## Introduction

In this walkthrough, we'll build a simple plugin that adds a new form component that can be used in forms. This also means it will be available to users in their panels.

You can find the final code for this plugin at [https://github.com/awcodes/headings](https://github.com/awcodes/headings).

## Step 1: Create the plugin

First, we'll create the plugin using the steps outlined in the [getting started guide](getting-started#creating-a-plugin).

## Step 2: Clean up

Next, we'll clean up the plugin to remove the boilerplate code we don't need. This will seem like a lot, but since this is a simple plugin, we can remove a lot of the boilerplate code.

Remove the following directories and files:
1. `bin`
2. `config`
3. `database`
4. `src/Commands`
5. `src/Facades`
6. `stubs`

Now we can clean up our `composer.json` file to remove unneeded options.

```json
"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
        // We can remove the database factories
        "Awcodes\\Headings\\Database\\Factories\\": "database/factories/"
    }
},
"extra": {
    "laravel": {
        // We can remove the facade
        "aliases": {
            "Headings": "Awcodes\\Headings\\Facades\\ClockWidget"
        }
    }
},
```

Normally, Filament recommends that users style their plugins with a custom filament theme, but for the sake of example let's provide our own stylesheet that can be loaded asynchronously using the new `x-load` features in Filament v3. So, let's update our `package.json` file to include `cssnano`, `postcss`, `postcss-cli` and `postcss-nesting` to build our stylesheet.

```json
{
    "private": true,
    "scripts": {
        "build": "postcss resources/css/index.css -o resources/dist/headings.css"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "cssnano": "^6.0.1",
        "postcss": "^8.4.27",
        "postcss-cli": "^10.1.0",
        "postcss-nesting": "^13.0.0"
    }
}
```

Then we need to install our dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

We will also need to update our `postcss.config.js` file to configure postcss.

```js
module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        require('postcss-nesting')(),
        require('cssnano')({
            preset: 'default',
        }),
    ],
};
```

You may also remove the testing directories and files, but we'll leave them in for now, although we won't be using them for this example, and we highly recommend that you write tests for your plugins.

## Step 3: Setting up the provider

Now that we have our plugin cleaned up, we can start adding our code. The boilerplate in the `src/HeadingsServiceProvider.php` file has a lot going on so, let's delete everything and start from scratch.

We need to be able to register our stylesheet with the Filament Asset Manager so that we can load it on demand in our blade view. To do this, we'll need to add the following to the `packageBooted` method in our service provider.

***Note the `loadedOnRequest()` method. This is important, because it tells Filament to only load the stylesheet when it's needed.***

```php
namespace Awcodes\Headings;

use Filament\Support\Assets\Css;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\Package;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\PackageServiceProvider;

class HeadingsServiceProvider extends PackageServiceProvider
{
    public static string $name = 'headings';

    public function configurePackage(Package $package): void
    {
        $package->name(static::$name)
            ->hasViews();
    }

    public function packageBooted(): void
    {
        FilamentAsset::register([
            Css::make('headings', __DIR__ . '/../resources/dist/headings.css')->loadedOnRequest(),
        ], 'awcodes/headings');
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Creating our component

Next, we'll need to create our component. Create a new file at `src/Heading.php` and add the following code.

```php
namespace Awcodes\Headings;

use Closure;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Component;
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;
use Filament\Support\Concerns\HasColor;

class Heading extends Component
{
    use HasColor;

    protected string | int $level = 2;

    protected string | Closure $content = '';

    protected string $view = 'headings::heading';

    final public function __construct(string | int $level)
    {
        $this->level($level);
    }

    public static function make(string | int $level): static
    {
        return app(static::class, ['level' => $level]);
    }

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        parent::setUp();

        $this->dehydrated(false);
    }

    public function content(string | Closure $content): static
    {
        $this->content = $content;

        return $this;
    }

    public function level(string | int $level): static
    {
        $this->level = $level;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getColor(): array
    {
        return $this->evaluate($this->color) ?? Color::Amber;
    }

    public function getContent(): string
    {
        return $this->evaluate($this->content);
    }

    public function getLevel(): string
    {
        return is_int($this->level) ? 'h' . $this->level : $this->level;
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Rendering our component

Next, we'll need to create the view for our component. Create a new file at `resources/views/heading.blade.php` and add the following code.

We are using x-load to asynchronously load stylesheet, so it's only loaded when necessary. You can learn more about this in the [Core Concepts](../advanced/assets#lazy-loading-css) section of the docs.

```blade
@php
    $level = $getLevel();
    $color = $getColor();
@endphp

<{{ $level }}
    x-data
    x-load-css="[@js(\Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getStyleHref('headings', package: 'awcodes/headings'))]"
    {{
        $attributes
            ->class([
                'headings-component',
                match ($color) {
                    'gray' => 'text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400',
                    default => 'text-custom-500',
                },
            ])
            ->style([
                \Filament\Support\get_color_css_variables($color, [500]) => $color !== 'gray',
            ])
    }}
>
    {{ $getContent() }}
</{{ $level }}>
```

## Step 6: Adding some styles

Next, let's provide some custom styling for our field. We'll add the following to `resources/css/index.css`. And run `npm run build` to compile our CSS.

```css
.headings-component {
    &:is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) {
         font-weight: 700;
         letter-spacing: -.025em;
         line-height: 1.1;
     }

    &h1 {
         font-size: 2rem;
     }

    &h2 {
         font-size: 1.75rem;
     }

    &h3 {
         font-size: 1.5rem;
     }

    &h4 {
         font-size: 1.25rem;
     }

    &h5,
    &h6 {
         font-size: 1rem;
     }
}
```

Then we need to build our stylesheet.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Step 7: Update your README

You'll want to update your `README.md` file to include instructions on how to install your plugin and any other information you want to share with users, Like how to use it in their projects. For example:

```php
use Awcodes\Headings\Heading;

Heading::make(2)
    ->content('Product Information')
    ->color(Color::Lime),
```

And, that's it, our users can now install our plugin and use it in their projects.

## Introduction

Filament packages consume a set of core components that aim to provide a consistent and maintainable foundation for all interfaces. Some of these components are also available for use in your own applications and Filament plugins.

## Package components

The various packages in the Filament project can be used outside of a panel:

- [Action](action)
- [Form](form)
- [Infolist](infolist)
- [Notifications](notifications)
- [Schema](schema)
- [Table](table)
- [Widget](widget)

## Blade components

Aside from the core packages, all Filament projects can also consume the Blade components that Filament uses internally:

- [Avatar](avatar)
- [Badge](badge)
- [Button](button)
- [Breadcrumbs](breadcrumbs)
- [Checkbox](checkbox)
- [Dropdown](dropdown)
- [Fieldset](fieldset)
- [Icon button](icon-button)
- [Input](input)
- [Input wrapper](input-wrapper)
- [Link](link)
- [Loading indicator](loading-indicator)
- [Modal](modal)
- [Pagination](pagination)
- [Section](section)
- [Select](select)
- [Tabs](tabs)

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

<Aside variant="warning">
    Before proceeding, make sure `filament/actions` is installed in your project. You can check by running:

    ```bash
    composer show filament/actions
    ```
    If it's not installed, consult the [installation guide](../introduction/installation#installing-the-individual-components) and configure the **individual components** according to the instructions.
</Aside>

## Setting up the Livewire component

First, generate a new Livewire component:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire ManagePost
```

Then, render your Livewire component on the page:

```blade
@livewire('manage-post')
```

Alternatively, you can use a full-page Livewire component:

```php
use App\Livewire\ManagePost;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('posts/{post}/manage', ManagePost::class);
```

You must use the `InteractsWithActions` and `InteractsWithSchemas` traits, and implement the `HasActions` and `HasSchemas` interfaces on your Livewire component class:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Concerns\InteractsWithActions;
use Filament\Actions\Contracts\HasActions;
use Filament\Schemas\Concerns\InteractsWithSchemas;
use Filament\Schemas\Contracts\HasSchemas;
use Livewire\Component;

class ManagePost extends Component implements HasActions, HasSchemas
{
    use InteractsWithActions;
    use InteractsWithSchemas;

    // ...
}
```

## Adding the action

Add a method that returns your action. The method must share the exact same name as the action, or the name followed by `Action`:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Actions\Concerns\InteractsWithActions;
use Filament\Actions\Contracts\HasActions;
use Filament\Schemas\Concerns\InteractsWithSchemas;
use Filament\Schemas\Contracts\HasSchemas;
use Livewire\Component;

class ManagePost extends Component implements HasActions, HasSchemas
{
    use InteractsWithActions;
    use InteractsWithSchemas;

    public Post $post;

    public function deleteAction(): Action
    {
        return Action::make('delete')
            ->color('danger')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(fn () => $this->post->delete());
    }
    
    // This method name also works, since the action name is `delete`:
    // public function delete(): Action
    
    // This method name does not work, since the action name is `delete`, not `deletePost`:
    // public function deletePost(): Action

    // ...
}
```

Finally, you need to render the action in your view. To do this, you can use `{{ $this->deleteAction }}`, where you replace `deleteAction` with the name of your action method:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $this->deleteAction }}

    <x-filament-actions::modals />
</div>
```

You also need `<x-filament-actions::modals />` which injects the HTML required to render action modals. This only needs to be included within the Livewire component once, regardless of how many actions you have for that component.

<Aside variant="info">
    `filament/actions` also includes the following packages:
    
    - `filament/forms`
    - `filament/infolists`
    - `filament/notifications`
    - `filament/support`
    
    These packages allow you to use their components within Livewire components.
    For example, if your action uses [Notifications](notifications), remember to include `@livewire('notifications')` in your layout and add `@import '../../vendor/filament/notifications/resources/css/index.css'` to your CSS file.
    
    If you are using any other [Filament components](overview#package-components) in your action, make sure to install and integrate the corresponding package as well.
</Aside>

## Passing action arguments

Sometimes, you may wish to pass arguments to your action. For example, if you're rendering the same action multiple times in the same view, but each time for a different model, you could pass the model ID as an argument, and then retrieve it later. To do this, you can invoke the action in your view and pass in the arguments as an array:

```php
<div>
    @foreach ($posts as $post)
        <h2>{{ $post->title }}</h2>

        {{ ($this->deleteAction)(['post' => $post->id]) }}
    @endforeach

    <x-filament-actions::modals />
</div>
```

Now, you can access the post ID in your action method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

public function deleteAction(): Action
{
    return Action::make('delete')
        ->color('danger')
        ->requiresConfirmation()
        ->action(function (array $arguments) {
            $post = Post::find($arguments['post']);

            $post?->delete();
        });
}
```

## Hiding actions in a Livewire view

If you use `hidden()` or `visible()` to control if an action is rendered, you should wrap the action in an `@if` check for `isVisible()`:

```blade
<div>
    @if ($this->deleteAction->isVisible())
        {{ $this->deleteAction }}
    @endif
    
    {{-- Or --}}
    
    @if (($this->deleteAction)(['post' => $post->id])->isVisible())
        {{ ($this->deleteAction)(['post' => $post->id]) }}
    @endif
</div>
```

The `hidden()` and `visible()` methods also control if the action is `disabled()`, so they are still useful to protect the action from being run if the user does not have permission. Encapsulating this logic in the `hidden()` or `visible()` of the action itself is good practice otherwise you need to define the condition in the view and in `disabled()`.

You can also take advantage of this to hide any wrapping elements that may not need to be rendered if the action is hidden:

```blade
<div>
    @if ($this->deleteAction->isVisible())
        <div>
            {{ $this->deleteAction }}
        </div>
    @endif
</div>
```

## Grouping actions in a Livewire view

You may [group actions together into a dropdown menu](grouping-actions) by using the `<x-filament-actions::group>` Blade component, passing in the `actions` array as an attribute:

```blade
<div>
    <x-filament-actions::group :actions="[
        $this->editAction,
        $this->viewAction,
        $this->deleteAction,
    ]" />

    <x-filament-actions::modals />
</div>
```

You can also pass in any attributes to customize the appearance of the trigger button and dropdown:

```blade
<div>
    <x-filament-actions::group
        :actions="[
            $this->editAction,
            $this->viewAction,
            $this->deleteAction,
        ]"
        label="Actions"
        icon="heroicon-m-ellipsis-vertical"
        color="primary"
        size="md"
        tooltip="More actions"
        dropdown-placement="bottom-start"
    />

    <x-filament-actions::modals />
</div>
```

## Chaining actions

You can chain multiple actions together, by calling the `replaceMountedAction()` method to replace the current action with another when it has finished:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

public function editAction(): Action
{
    return Action::make('edit')
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ])
        // ...
        ->action(function (array $arguments) {
            $post = Post::find($arguments['post']);

            // ...

            $this->replaceMountedAction('publish', $arguments);
        });
}

public function publishAction(): Action
{
    return Action::make('publish')
        ->requiresConfirmation()
        // ...
        ->action(function (array $arguments) {
            $post = Post::find($arguments['post']);

            $post->publish();
        });
}
```

Now, when the first action is submitted, the second action will open in its place. The [arguments](#passing-action-arguments) that were originally passed to the first action get passed to the second action, so you can use them to persist data between requests.

If the first action is canceled, the second one is not opened. If the second action is canceled, the first one has already run and cannot be cancelled.

## Programmatically triggering actions

Sometimes you may need to trigger an action without the user clicking on the built-in trigger button, especially from JavaScript. Here is an example action which could be registered on a Livewire component:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

public function testAction(): Action
{
    return Action::make('test')
        ->requiresConfirmation()
        ->action(function (array $arguments) {
            dd('Test action called', $arguments);
        });
}
```

You can trigger that action from a click in your HTML using the `wire:click` attribute, calling the `mountAction()` method and optionally passing in any arguments that you want to be available:

```blade
<button wire:click="mountAction('test', { id: 12345 })">
    Button
</button>
```

To trigger that action from JavaScript, you can use the [`$wire` utility](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/alpine#controlling-livewire-from-alpine-using-wire), passing in the same arguments:

```js
$wire.mountAction('test', { id: 12345 })
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    Before proceeding, make sure `filament/forms` is installed in your project. You can check by running:

    ```bash
    composer show filament/forms
    ```
    If it's not installed, consult the [installation guide](../introduction/installation#installing-the-individual-components) and configure the **individual components** according to the instructions.
</Aside>

## Setting up the Livewire component

First, generate a new Livewire component:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire CreatePost
```

Then, render your Livewire component on the page:

```blade
@livewire('create-post')
```

Alternatively, you can use a full-page Livewire component:

```php
use App\Livewire\CreatePost;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('posts/create', CreatePost::class);
```

## Adding the form

<Aside variant="warning">
    Before proceeding, please ensure that the **Forms package** is installed in your project. Consult the [installation guide](../introduction/installation#installing-the-individual-components) and configure the **individual components** according to the instructions.
</Aside>

There are 5 main tasks when adding a form to a Livewire component class. Each one is essential:

1) Implement the `HasSchemas` interface and use the `InteractsWithSchemas` trait.
2) Define a public Livewire property to store your form's data. In our example, we'll call this `$data`, but you can call it whatever you want.
3) Add a `form()` method, which is where you configure the form. [Add the form's schema](getting-started#form-schemas), and tell Filament to store the form data in the `$data` property (using `statePath('data')`).
4) Initialize the form with `$this->form->fill()` in `mount()`. This is imperative for every form that you build, even if it doesn't have any initial data.
5) Define a method to handle the form submission. In our example, we'll call this `create()`, but you can call it whatever you want. Inside that method, you can validate and get the form's data using `$this->form->getState()`. It's important that you use this method instead of accessing the `$this->data` property directly, because the form's data needs to be validated and transformed into a useful format before being returned.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Livewire;

use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Concerns\InteractsWithSchemas;
use Filament\Schemas\Contracts\HasSchemas;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;
use Livewire\Component;

class CreatePost extends Component implements HasSchemas
{
    use InteractsWithSchemas;
    
    public ?array $data = [];
    
    public function mount(): void
    {
        $this->form->fill();
    }
    
    public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
    {
        return $schema
            ->components([
                TextInput::make('title')
                    ->required(),
                MarkdownEditor::make('content'),
                // ...
            ])
            ->statePath('data');
    }
    
    public function create(): void
    {
        dd($this->form->getState());
    }
    
    public function render(): View
    {
        return view('livewire.create-post');
    }
}
```

Finally, in your Livewire component's view, render the form:

```blade
<div>
    <form wire:submit="create">
        {{ $this->form }}
        
        <button type="submit">
            Submit
        </button>
    </form>
    
    <x-filament-actions::modals />
</div>
```

<Aside variant="info">
    `<x-filament-actions::modals />` is used to render form component [action modals](../schemas/actions). The code can be put anywhere outside the `<form>` element, as long as it's within the Livewire component.
</Aside>

Visit your Livewire component in the browser, and you should see the form components from `components()`:

Submit the form with data, and you'll see the form's data dumped to the screen. You can save the data to a model instead of dumping it:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

public function create(): void
{
    Post::create($this->form->getState());
}
```

<Aside variant="info">
    `filament/forms` also includes the following packages:

    - `filament/actions`
    - `filament/schemas`
    - `filament/support`
    
    These packages allow you to use their components within Livewire components.
    For example, if your form uses [Actions](../actions), remember to implement the `HasActions` interface and use the `InteractsWithActions` trait on your Livewire component class.
    
    If you are using any other [Filament components](overview#package-components) in your form, make sure to install and integrate the corresponding package as well.
</Aside>

## Initializing the form with data

To fill the form with data, just pass that data to the `$this->form->fill()` method. For example, if you're editing an existing post, you might do something like this:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

public function mount(Post $post): void
{
    $this->form->fill($post->attributesToArray());
}
```

It's important that you use the `$this->form->fill()` method instead of assigning the data directly to the `$this->data` property. This is because the post's data needs to be internally transformed into a useful format before being stored.

## Setting a form model

Giving the `$form` access to a model is useful for a few reasons:

- It allows fields within that form to load information from that model. For example, select fields can [load their options from the database](fields/select#integrating-with-an-eloquent-relationship) automatically.
- The form can load and save the model's relationship data automatically. For example, you have an Edit Post form, with a [Repeater](fields/repeater#integrating-with-an-eloquent-relationship) which manages comments associated with that post. Filament will automatically load the comments for that post when you call `$this->form->fill([...])`, and save them back to the relationship when you call `$this->form->getState()`.
- Validation rules like `exists()` and `unique()` can automatically retrieve the database table name from the model.

It is advised to always pass the model to the form when there is one. As explained, it unlocks many new powers of Filament's form system.

To pass the model to the form, use the `$form->model()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public Post $post;

public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            // ...
        ])
        ->statePath('data')
        ->model($this->post);
}
```

### Passing the form model after the form has been submitted

In some cases, the form's model is not available until the form has been submitted. For example, in a Create Post form, the post does not exist until the form has been submitted. Therefore, you can't pass it in to `$form->model()`. However, you can pass a model class instead:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            // ...
        ])
        ->statePath('data')
        ->model(Post::class);
}
```

On its own, this isn't as powerful as passing a model instance. For example, relationships won't be saved to the post after it is created. To do that, you'll need to pass the post to the form after it has been created, and call `saveRelationships()` to save the relationships to it:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

public function create(): void
{
    $post = Post::create($this->form->getState());
    
    // Save the relationships from the form to the post after it is created.
    $this->form->model($post)->saveRelationships();
}
```

## Saving form data to individual properties

In all of our previous examples, we've been saving the form's data to the public `$data` property on the Livewire component. However, you can save the data to individual properties instead. For example, if you have a form with a `title` field, you can save the form's data to the `$title` property instead. To do this, don't pass a `statePath()` to the form at all. Ensure that all of your fields have their own **public** properties on the class.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public ?string $title = null;

public ?string $content = null;

public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            TextInput::make('title')
                ->required(),
            MarkdownEditor::make('content'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Using multiple forms

By default, the `InteractsWithForms` trait only handles one form per Livewire component - `form()`. To add more forms to the Livewire component, you can define them in the `getForms()` method, and return an array containing the name of each form:

```php
protected function getForms(): array
{
    return [
        'editPostForm',
        'createCommentForm',
    ];
}
```

Each of these forms can now be defined within the Livewire component, using a method with the same name:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function editPostForm(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            TextInput::make('title')
                ->required(),
            MarkdownEditor::make('content'),
            // ...
        ])
        ->statePath('postData')
        ->model($this->post);
}

public function createCommentForm(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->components([
            TextInput::make('name')
                ->required(),
            TextInput::make('email')
                ->email()
                ->required(),
            MarkdownEditor::make('content')
                ->required(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->statePath('commentData')
        ->model(Comment::class);
}
```

Now, each form is addressable by its name instead of `form`. For example, to fill the post form, you can use `$this->editPostForm->fill([...])`, or to get the data from the comment form you can use `$this->createCommentForm->getState()`.

You'll notice that each form has its own unique `statePath()`. Each form will write its state to a different array on your Livewire component, so it's important to define these:

```php
public ?array $postData = [];
public ?array $commentData = [];
```

## Resetting a form's data

You can reset a form back to its default data at any time by calling `$this->form->fill()`. For example, you may wish to clear the contents of a form every time it's submitted:

```php
use App\Models\Comment;

public function createComment(): void
{
    Comment::create($this->form->getState());

    // Reinitialize the form to clear its data.
    $this->form->fill();
}
```

## Generating form Livewire components with the CLI

It's advised that you learn how to set up a Livewire component with forms manually, but once you are confident, you can use the CLI to generate a form for you.

```bash
php artisan make:filament-livewire-form RegistrationForm
```

This will generate a new `app/Livewire/RegistrationForm.php` component, which you can customize.

### Generating a form for an Eloquent model

Filament is also able to generate forms for a specific Eloquent model. These are more powerful, as they will automatically save the data in the form for you, and [ensure the form fields are properly configured](#setting-a-form-model) to access that model.

When generating a form with the `make:livewire-form` command, it will ask for the name of the model:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-livewire-form Products/CreateProduct
```

#### Generating an edit form for an Eloquent record

By default, passing a model to the `make:livewire-form` command will result in a form that creates a new record in your database. If you pass the `--edit` flag to the command, it will generate an edit form for a specific record. This will automatically fill the form with the data from the record, and save the data back to the model when the form is submitted.

```bash
php artisan make:filament-livewire-form Products/EditProduct --edit
```

### Automatically generating form schemas

Filament is also able to guess which form fields you want in the schema, based on the model's database columns. You can use the `--generate` flag when generating your form:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-livewire-form Products/CreateProduct --generate
```

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

<Aside variant="warning">
    Before proceeding, make sure `filament/infolists` is installed in your project. You can check by running:

    ```bash
    composer show filament/infolists
    ```
    If it's not installed, consult the [installation guide](../introduction/installation#installing-the-individual-components) and configure the **individual components** according to the instructions.
</Aside>

## Setting up the Livewire component

First, generate a new Livewire component:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire ViewProduct
```

Then, render your Livewire component on the page:

```blade
@livewire('view-product')
```

Alternatively, you can use a full-page Livewire component:

```php
use App\Livewire\ViewProduct;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('products/{product}', ViewProduct::class);
```

You must use the `InteractsWithSchemas` trait, and implement the `HasSchemas` interface on your Livewire component class:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Concerns\InteractsWithSchemas;
use Filament\Schemas\Contracts\HasSchemas;
use Livewire\Component;

class ViewProduct extends Component implements HasSchemas
{
    use InteractsWithSchemas;

    // ...
}
```

## Adding the infolist

Next, add a method to the Livewire component which accepts an `$infolist` object, modifies it, and returns it:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function productInfolist(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->record($this->product)
        ->components([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Finally, render the infolist in the Livewire component's view:

```blade
{{ $this->productInfolist }}
```

<Aside variant="info">
    `filament/infolists` also includes the following packages:

    - `filament/actions`
    - `filament/schemas`
    - `filament/support`
    
    These packages allow you to use their components within Livewire components.
    For example, if your infolist uses [Actions](../actions), remember to implement the `HasActions` interface and use the `InteractsWithActions` trait on your Livewire component class.
    
    If you are using any other [Filament components](overview#package-components) in your infolist, make sure to install and integrate the corresponding package as well.

</Aside>

## Passing data to the infolist

You can pass data to the infolist in two ways:

Either pass an Eloquent model instance to the `record()` method of the infolist, to automatically map all the model attributes and relationships to the entries in the infolist's schema:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function productInfolist(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->record($this->product)
        ->components([
            TextEntry::make('name'),
            TextEntry::make('category.name'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Alternatively, you can pass an array of data to the `state()` method of the infolist, to manually map the data to the entries in the infolist's schema:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function productInfolist(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->constantState([
            'name' => 'MacBook Pro',
            'category' => [
                'name' => 'Laptops',
            ],
            // ...
        ])
        ->components([
            TextEntry::make('name'),
            TextEntry::make('category.name'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

<Aside variant="warning">
    Before proceeding, make sure `filament/tables` is installed in your project. You can check by running:

    ```bash
    composer show filament/tables
    ```
    If it's not installed, consult the [installation guide](../introduction/installation#installing-the-individual-components) and configure the **individual components** according to the instructions.
</Aside>

## Setting up the Livewire component

First, generate a new Livewire component:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire ListProducts
```

Then, render your Livewire component on the page:

```blade
@livewire('list-products')
```

Alternatively, you can use a full-page Livewire component:

```php
use App\Livewire\ListProducts;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('products', ListProducts::class);
```

## Adding the table

There are 3 tasks when adding a table to a Livewire component class:

1) Implement the `HasTable` and `HasSchemas` interfaces, and use the `InteractsWithTable` and `InteractsWithSchemas` traits.
2) Add a `table()` method, which is where you configure the table. [Add the table's columns, filters, and actions](getting-started#columns).
3) Make sure to define the base query that will be used to fetch rows in the table. For example, if you're listing products from your `Product` model, you will want to return `Product::query()`.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Livewire;

use App\Models\Shop\Product;
use Filament\Actions\Concerns\InteractsWithActions;  
use Filament\Actions\Contracts\HasActions;
use Filament\Schemas\Concerns\InteractsWithSchemas;
use Filament\Schemas\Contracts\HasSchemas;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Concerns\InteractsWithTable;
use Filament\Tables\Contracts\HasTable;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;
use Livewire\Component;

class ListProducts extends Component implements HasActions, HasSchemas, HasTable
{
    use InteractsWithActions;
    use InteractsWithSchemas;
    use InteractsWithTable;
    
    public function table(Table $table): Table
    {
        return $table
            ->query(Product::query())
            ->columns([
                TextColumn::make('name'),
            ])
            ->filters([
                // ...
            ])
            ->recordActions([
                // ...
            ])
            ->toolbarActions([
                // ...
            ]);
    }
    
    public function render(): View
    {
        return view('livewire.list-products');
    }
}
```

Finally, in your Livewire component's view, render the table:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $this->table }}
</div>
```

Visit your Livewire component in the browser, and you should see the table.

<Aside variant="info">

    `filament/tables` also includes the following packages:
    
    - `filament/actions`
    - `filament/forms`
    - `filament/support`
    
    These packages allow you to use their components within Livewire components.
    For example, if your table uses [Actions](action#setting-up-the-livewire-component), remember to implement the `HasActions` interface and include the `InteractsWithActions` trait.
    
    If you are using any other [Filament components](overview#package-components) in your table, make sure to install and integrate the corresponding package as well.
</Aside>

## Building a table for an Eloquent relationship

If you want to build a table for an Eloquent relationship, you can use the `relationship()` and `inverseRelationship()` methods on the `$table` instead of passing a `query()`. `HasMany`, `HasManyThrough`, `BelongsToMany`, `MorphMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships are compatible:

```php
use App\Models\Category;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsToMany;

public Category $category;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->relationship(fn (): BelongsToMany => $this->category->products())
        ->inverseRelationship('categories')
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('name'),
        ]);
}
```

In this example, we have a `$category` property which holds a `Category` model instance. The category has a relationship named `products`. We use a function to return the relationship instance. This is a many-to-many relationship, so the inverse relationship is called `categories`, and is defined on the `Product` model. We just need to pass the name of this relationship to the `inverseRelationship()` method, not the whole instance.

Now that the table is using a relationship instead of a plain Eloquent query, all actions will be performed on the relationship instead of the query. For example, if you use a [`CreateAction`](../actions/create), the new product will be automatically attached to the category.

If your relationship uses a pivot table, you can use all pivot columns as if they were normal columns on your table, as long as they are listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship definition.

Relationship tables are used in the Panel Builder as ["relation managers"](../panels/resources/managing-relationships#creating-a-relation-manager). Most of the documented features for relation managers are also available for relationship tables. For instance, [attaching and detaching](../panels/resources/managing-relationships#attaching-and-detaching-records) and [associating and dissociating](../panels/resources/relation-managers#associating-and-dissociating-records) actions.

## Generating table Livewire components with the CLI

It's advised that you learn how to set up a Livewire component with the Table Builder manually, but once you are confident, you can use the CLI to generate a table for you.

```bash
php artisan make:livewire-table Products/ListProducts
```

This will ask you for the name of a prebuilt model, for example `Product`. Finally, it will generate a new `app/Livewire/Products/ListProducts.php` component, which you can customize.

### Automatically generating table columns

Filament is also able to guess which table columns you want in the table, based on the model's database columns. You can use the `--generate` flag when generating your table:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire-table Products/ListProducts --generate
```

```blade
<x-filament::avatar
    src="https://filamentphp.com/dan.jpg"
    alt="Dan Harrin"
/>
```

## Setting the rounding of an avatar

Avatars are fully rounded by default, but you may make them square by setting the `circular` attribute to `false`:

```blade
<x-filament::avatar
    src="https://filamentphp.com/dan.jpg"
    alt="Dan Harrin"
    :circular="false"
/>
```

## Setting the size of an avatar

By default, the avatar will be "medium" size. You can set the size to either `sm`, `md`, or `lg` using the `size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::avatar
    src="https://filamentphp.com/dan.jpg"
    alt="Dan Harrin"
    size="lg"
/>
```

You can also pass your own custom size classes into the `size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::avatar
    src="https://filamentphp.com/dan.jpg"
    alt="Dan Harrin"
    size="w-12 h-12"
/>

<!-- Source: docs/12-components/03-checkbox.md -->

---

---
title: Checkbox Blade component
---

## Introduction

You can use the checkbox component to render a checkbox input that can be used to toggle a boolean value:

```blade
<label>
    <x-filament::input.checkbox wire:model="isAdmin" />

    <span>
        Is Admin
    </span>
</label>
```

## Triggering the error state of the checkbox

The checkbox has special styling that you can use if it is invalid. To trigger this styling, you can use either Blade or Alpine.js.

To trigger the error state using Blade, you can pass the `valid` attribute to the component, which contains either true or false based on if the checkbox is valid or not:

```blade
<x-filament::input.checkbox
    wire:model="isAdmin"
    :valid="! $errors->has('isAdmin')"
/>
```

Alternatively, you can use an Alpine.js expression to trigger the error state, based on if it evaluates to `true` or `false`:

```blade
<div x-data="{ errors: ['isAdmin'] }">
    <x-filament::input.checkbox
        x-model="isAdmin"
        alpine-valid="! errors.includes('isAdmin')"
    />
</div>
```

    </x-filament::dropdown.list>
</x-filament::dropdown>
```

## Using a dropdown item as an anchor link

By default, a dropdown item's underlying HTML tag is `<button>`. You can change it to be an `<a>` tag by using the `tag` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item
    href="https://filamentphp.com"
    tag="a"
>
    Filament
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

## Changing the color of a dropdown item

By default, the color of a dropdown item is "gray". You can change it to be `danger`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning` by using the `color` attribute:

```

## Adding an icon to a dropdown item

You can add an [icon](../styling/icons) to a dropdown item by using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

### Changing the icon color of a dropdown item

By default, the icon color uses the [same color as the item itself](#changing-the-color-of-a-dropdown-item). You can override it to be `danger`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning` by using the `icon-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil" icon-color="danger">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil" icon-color="info">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil" icon-color="primary">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil" icon-color="success">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

## Adding an image to a dropdown item

You can add a circular image to a dropdown item by using the `image` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item image="https://filamentphp.com/dan.jpg">
    Dan Harrin
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

## Adding a badge to a dropdown item

You can render a [badge](badge) on top of a dropdown item by using the `badge` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
    Mark notifications as read
    
    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

You can [change the color](badge#changing-the-color-of-the-badge) of the badge using the `badge-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item badge-color="danger">
    Mark notifications as read
    
    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

## Setting the placement of a dropdown

The dropdown may be positioned relative to the trigger button by using the `placement` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown placement="top-start">
    {{-- Dropdown items --}}
</x-filament::dropdown>
```

## Setting the width of a dropdown

The dropdown may be set to a width by using the `width` attribute. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, `5xl`, `6xl` and `7xl`:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown width="xs">
    {{-- Dropdown items --}}
</x-filament::dropdown>
```

## Controlling the maximum height of a dropdown

The dropdown content can have a maximum height using the `max-height` attribute, so that it scrolls. You can pass a [CSS length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length):

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown max-height="400px">
    {{-- Dropdown items --}}
</x-filament::dropdown>
```

<!-- Source: docs/12-components/03-input-wrapper.md -->

---

---
title: Input wrapper Blade component
---

## Introduction

The input wrapper component should be used as a wrapper around the [input](input) or [select](select) components. It provides a border and other elements such as a prefix or suffix.

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper>
    <x-filament::input
        type="text"
        wire:model="name"
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>

<x-filament::input.wrapper>
    <x-filament::input.select wire:model="status">
        <option value="draft">Draft</option>
        <option value="reviewing">Reviewing</option>
        <option value="published">Published</option>
    </x-filament::input.select>
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

## Triggering the error state of the input

The component has special styling that you can use if it is invalid. To trigger this styling, you can use either Blade or Alpine.js.

To trigger the error state using Blade, you can pass the `valid` attribute to the component, which contains either true or false based on if the input is valid or not:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper :valid="! $errors->has('name')">
    <x-filament::input
        type="text"
        wire:model="name"
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

Alternatively, you can use an Alpine.js expression to trigger the error state, based on if it evaluates to `true` or `false`:

```blade
<div x-data="{ errors: ['name'] }">
    <x-filament::input.wrapper alpine-valid="! errors.includes('name')">
        <x-filament::input
            type="text"
            wire:model="name"
        />
    </x-filament::input.wrapper>
</div>
```

## Disabling the input

To disable the input, you must also pass the `disabled` attribute to the wrapper component:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper disabled>
    <x-filament::input
        type="text"
        wire:model="name"
        disabled
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

## Adding affix text aside the input

You may place text before and after the input using the `prefix` and `suffix` slots:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper>
    <x-slot name="prefix">
        https://
    </x-slot>

    <x-filament::input
        type="text"
        wire:model="domain"
    />

    <x-slot name="suffix">
        .com
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

### Using icons as affixes

You may place an [icon](../styling/icons) before and after the input using the `prefix-icon` and `suffix-icon` attributes:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper suffix-icon="heroicon-m-globe-alt">
    <x-filament::input
        type="url"
        wire:model="domain"
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

#### Setting the affix icon's color

Affix icons are gray by default, but you may set a different color using the `prefix-icon-color` and `affix-icon-color` attributes:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper
    suffix-icon="heroicon-m-check-circle"
    suffix-icon-color="success"
>
    <x-filament::input
        type="url"
        wire:model="domain"
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

---
title: Input Blade component
---

## Introduction

The input component is a wrapper around the native `<input>` element. It provides a simple interface for entering a single line of text.

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper>
    <x-filament::input
        type="text"
        wire:model="name"
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

To use the input component, you must wrap it in an "input wrapper" component, which provides a border and other elements such as a prefix or suffix. You can learn more about customizing the input wrapper component [here](input-wrapper).


---

<!-- Source: docs/12-components/03-link.md -->

---

---
title: Link Blade component
---

## Introduction

The link component is used to render a clickable link that can perform an action:

```blade
<x-filament::link :href="route('users.create')">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Using a link as a button

By default, a link's underlying HTML tag is `<a>`. You can change it to be a `<button>` tag by using the `tag` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link
    wire:click="openNewUserModal"
    tag="button"
>
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Setting the size of a link

By default, the size of a link is "medium". You can make it "small", "large", "extra large" or "extra extra large" by using the `size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link size="sm">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link size="lg">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link size="xl">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link size="2xl">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Setting the font weight of a link

By default, the font weight of links is `semibold`. You can make it `thin`, `extralight`, `light`, `normal`, `medium`, `bold`, `extrabold` or `black` by using the `weight` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link weight="thin">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="extralight">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="light">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="normal">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="medium">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="semibold">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
   
<x-filament::link weight="bold">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="black">
    New user
</x-filament::link> 
```

Alternatively, you can pass in a custom CSS class to define the weight:

```blade
<x-filament::link weight="md:font-[650]">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Changing the color of a link

By default, the color of a link is "primary". You can change it to be `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `success` or `warning` by using the `color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link color="danger">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link color="gray">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link color="info">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link color="success">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link color="warning">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Adding an icon to a link

You can add an [icon](../styling/icons) to a link by using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link icon="heroicon-m-sparkles">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

You can also change the icon's position to be after the text instead of before it, using the `icon-position` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link
    icon="heroicon-m-sparkles"
    icon-position="after"
>
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Adding a tooltip to a link

You can add a tooltip to a link by using the `tooltip` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link tooltip="Register a user">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Adding a badge to a link

You can render a [badge](badge) on top of a link by using the `badge` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::link>
    Mark notifications as read

    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::link>
```

You can [change the color](badge#changing-the-color-of-the-badge) of the badge using the `badge-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link badge-color="danger">

<!-- Source: docs/12-components/03-loading-indicator.md -->

---

---
title: Loading indicator Blade component
---

## Introduction

The loading indicator is an animated SVG that can be used to indicate that something is in progress:

```blade
<x-filament::loading-indicator class="h-5 w-5" />
```


---

<!-- Source: docs/12-components/03-modal.md -->

---

---
title: Modal Blade component
---

## Introduction

The modal component is able to open a dialog window or slide-over with any content:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    <x-slot name="trigger">
        <x-filament::button>
            Open modal
        </x-filament::button>
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Controlling a modal from JavaScript

You can use the `trigger` slot to render a button that opens the modal. However, this is not required. You have complete control over when the modal opens and closes through JavaScript. First, give the modal an ID so that you can reference it:

```blade
<x-filament::modal id="edit-user">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

Now, you can dispatch an `open-modal` or `close-modal` browser event, passing the modal's ID, which will open or close the modal. For example, from a Livewire component:

```php
$this->dispatch('open-modal', id: 'edit-user');
```

Or from Alpine.js:

```php
$dispatch('open-modal', { id: 'edit-user' })
```

## Adding a heading to a modal

You can add a heading to a modal by using the `heading` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Adding a description to a modal

You can add a description, below the heading, to a modal by using the `description` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    <x-slot name="description">
        Modal description
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Adding an icon to a modal

You can add an [icon](../styling/icons) to a modal by using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal icon="heroicon-o-information-circle">
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

By default, the color of an icon is "primary". You can change it to be `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `success` or `warning` by using the `icon-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal
    icon="heroicon-o-exclamation-triangle"
    icon-color="danger"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Adding a footer to a modal

You can add a footer to a modal by using the `footer` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    {{-- Modal content --}}
    
    <x-slot name="footer">
        {{-- Modal footer content --}}
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::modal>
```

Alternatively, you can add actions into the footer by using the `footerActions` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    {{-- Modal content --}}
    
    <x-slot name="footerActions">
        {{-- Modal footer actions --}}
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Changing the modal's alignment

By default, modal content will be aligned to the start, or centered if the modal is `xs` or `sm` in [width](#changing-the-modal-width). If you wish to change the alignment of content in a modal, you can use the `alignment` attribute and pass it `start` or `center`:

```blade
<x-filament::modal alignment="center">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Using a slide-over instead of a modal

You can open a "slide-over" dialog instead of a modal by using the `slide-over` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal slide-over>
    {{-- Slide-over content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Making the modal header sticky

The header of a modal scrolls out of view with the modal content when it overflows the modal size. However, slide-overs have a sticky modal that's always visible. You may control this behavior using the `sticky-header` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal sticky-header>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Making the modal footer sticky

The footer of a modal is rendered inline after the content by default. Slide-overs, however, have a sticky footer that always shows when scrolling the content. You may enable this for a modal too using the `sticky-footer` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal sticky-footer>
    {{-- Modal content --}}
    
    <x-slot name="footer">
        {{-- Modal footer content --}}
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Changing the modal width

You can change the width of the modal by using the `width` attribute. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, `5xl`, `6xl`, `7xl`, and `screen`:

```blade
<x-filament::modal width="5xl">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Closing the modal by clicking away

By default, when you click away from a modal, it will close itself. If you wish to disable this behavior for a specific action, you can use the `close-by-clicking-away` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal :close-by-clicking-away="false">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Closing the modal by escaping

By default, when you press escape on a modal, it will close itself. If you wish to disable this behavior for a specific action, you can use the `close-by-escaping` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal :close-by-escaping="false">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Hiding the modal close button

By default, modals with a header have a close button in the top right corner. You can remove the close button from the modal by using the `close-button` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal :close-button="false">
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Preventing the modal from autofocusing

By default, modals will autofocus on the first focusable element when opened. If you wish to disable this behavior, you can use the `autofocus` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal :autofocus="false">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Disabling the modal trigger button

By default, the trigger button will open the modal even if it is disabled, since the click event listener is registered on a wrapping element of the button itself. If you want to prevent the modal from opening, you should also use the `disabled` attribute on the trigger slot:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    <x-slot name="trigger" disabled>
        <x-filament::button :disabled="true">
            Open modal
        </x-filament::button>
    </x-slot>
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

title: Pagination Blade component
---

## Introduction

The pagination component can be used in a Livewire Blade view only. It can render a list of paginated links:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;
use Livewire\Component;

class ListUsers extends Component
{
    // ...
    
    public function render(): View
    {
        return view('livewire.list-users', [
            'users' => User::query()->paginate(10),
        ]);
    }
}
```

```blade
<x-filament::pagination :paginator="$users" />
```

Alternatively, you can use simple pagination or cursor pagination, which will just render a "previous" and "next" button:

```php
use App\Models\User;

User::query()->simplePaginate(10)
User::query()->cursorPaginate(10)
```

## Allowing the user to customize the number of items per page

You can allow the user to customize the number of items per page by passing an array of options to the `page-options` attribute. You must also define a Livewire property where the user's selection will be stored:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;
use Livewire\Component;

class ListUsers extends Component
{
    public int | string $perPage = 10;
    
    // ...
    
    public function render(): View
    {
        return view('livewire.list-users', [
            'users' => User::query()->paginate($this->perPage),
        ]);
    }
}
```

```blade
<x-filament::pagination
    :paginator="$users"
    :page-options="[5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 'all']"
    :current-page-option-property="perPage"
/>
```

## Displaying links to the first and the last page

Extreme links are the first and last page links. You can add them by passing the `extreme-links` attribute to the component:

```blade
<x-filament::pagination
    :paginator="$users"
    extreme-links
/>
```

---
title: Section Blade component
---

## Introduction

A section can be used to group content together, with an optional heading:

```blade
<x-filament::section>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

## Adding a description to the section

You can add a description below the heading to the section by using the `description` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::section>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    <x-slot name="description">
        This is all the information we hold about the user.
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

## Adding an icon to the section header

You can add an [icon](../styling/icons) to a section by using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section icon="heroicon-o-user">
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

### Changing the color of the section icon

By default, the color of the section icon is "gray". You can change it to be `danger`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning` by using the `icon-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section
    icon="heroicon-o-user"
    icon-color="info"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

### Changing the size of the section icon

By default, the size of the section icon is "large". You can change it to be "small" or "medium" by using the `icon-size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section
    icon="heroicon-m-user"
    icon-size="sm"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>

<x-filament::section
    icon="heroicon-m-user"
    icon-size="md"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

## Adding content to the end of the header

You may render additional content at the end of the header, next to the heading and description, using the `afterHeader` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::section>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    <x-slot name="afterHeader">
        {{-- Input to select the user's ID --}}
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

## Making a section collapsible

You can make the content of a section collapsible by using the `collapsible` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section collapsible>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

### Making a section collapsed by default

You can make a section collapsed by default by using the `collapsed` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section
    collapsible
    collapsed
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

### Persisting collapsed sections

You can persist whether a section is collapsed in local storage using the `persist-collapsed` attribute, so it will remain collapsed when the user refreshes the page. You will also need a unique `id` attribute to identify the section from others, so that each section can persist its own collapse state:

```blade
<x-filament::section
    collapsible
    collapsed
    persist-collapsed
    id="user-details"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

## Adding the section header aside the content instead of above it

You can change the position of the section header to be aside the content instead of above it by using the `aside` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section aside>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

### Positioning the content before the header

You can change the position of the content to be before the header instead of after it by using the `content-before` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section
    aside
    content-before
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

title: Select Blade component
---

## Introduction

The select component is a wrapper around the native `<select>` element. It provides a simple interface for selecting a single value from a list of options:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper>
    <x-filament::input.select wire:model="status">
        <option value="draft">Draft</option>
        <option value="reviewing">Reviewing</option>
        <option value="published">Published</option>
    </x-filament::input.select>
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

To use the select component, you must wrap it in an "input wrapper" component, which provides a border and other elements such as a prefix or suffix. You can learn more about customizing the input wrapper component [here](input-wrapper).


---

<!-- Source: docs/12-components/03-tabs.md -->

---

---
title: Tabs Blade component
---

## Introduction

The tabs component allows you to render a set of tabs, which can be used to toggle between multiple sections of content:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs label="Content tabs">
    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Tab 1
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Tab 2
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Tab 3
    </x-filament::tabs.item>
</x-filament::tabs>
```

## Triggering the active state of the tab

By default, tabs do not appear "active". To make a tab appear active, you can use the `active` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item active>
        Tab 1
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

You can also use the `active` attribute to make a tab appear active conditionally:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item
        :active="$activeTab === 'tab1'"
        wire:click="$set('activeTab', 'tab1')"
    >
        Tab 1
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

Or you can use the `alpine-active` attribute to make a tab appear active conditionally using Alpine.js:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs x-data="{ activeTab: 'tab1' }">
    <x-filament::tabs.item
        alpine-active="activeTab === 'tab1'"
        x-on:click="activeTab = 'tab1'"
    >
        Tab 1
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

## Setting a tab icon

Tabs may have an [icon](../styling/icons), which you can set using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item icon="heroicon-m-bell">
        Notifications
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

### Setting the tab icon position

The icon of the tab may be positioned before or after the label using the `icon-position` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item
        icon="heroicon-m-bell"
        icon-position="after"
    >
        Notifications
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

## Setting a tab badge

Tabs may have a [badge](badge), which you can set using the `badge` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Notifications

        <x-slot name="badge">
            5
        </x-slot>
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

## Using a tab as an anchor link

By default, a tab's underlying HTML tag is `<button>`. You can change it to be an `<a>` tag by using the `tag` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item
        :href="route('notifications')"
        tag="a"
    >
        Notifications
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

## Using vertical tabs

You can render the tabs vertically by using the `vertical` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs vertical>
    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Tab 1
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Tab 2
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Tab 3
    </x-filament::tabs.item>
</x-filament::tabs>
```

title: Deploying to production
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

## Introduction

Deploying a Laravel app using Filament to production is similar to deploying any other Laravel app. However, there are a few additional steps you should take to ensure that your Filament panel is optimized for performance and security.

For tips focused on local development performance, see [Optimizing local dev](introduction/optimizing-local-dev).

## Ensure that users are authorized to access panels

When Filament detects that your app's `APP_ENV` is not `local`, it will require you to set up authorization for your users. This is to ensure that only authorized users can access your Filament panel in production, while keeping the local environment easy to get started with.

To authorize users to access a panel, you should follow the [guide in the users section](users/overview#uthorizing-access-to-the-panel).

<Aside variant="warning">
    If you do not follow these steps and your user model does not implement the `FilamentUser` interface, no users will be able to sign in to your panel in production.
</Aside>

## Improving Filament panel performance

### Optimizing Filament for production

To optimize Filament for production, you should run the following command in your deployment script:

```bash
php artisan filament:optimize
```

This command will [cache the Filament components](#caching-filament-components) and additionally the [Blade icons](#caching-blade-icons), which can significantly improve the performance of your Filament panels. This command is a shorthand for the commands `php artisan filament:cache-components` and `php artisan icons:cache`.

To clear the caches at once, you can run:

```bash
php artisan filament:optimize-clear
```

#### Caching Filament components

If you're not using the [`filament:optimize` command](#optimizing-filament-for-production), you may wish to consider running `php artisan filament:cache-components` in your deployment script, especially if you have large numbers of components (resources, pages, widgets, relation managers, custom Livewire components, etc.). This will create cache files in the `bootstrap/cache/filament` directory of your application, which contain indexes for each type of component. This can significantly improve the performance of Filament in some apps, as it reduces the number of files that need to be scanned and auto-discovered for components.

However, if you are actively developing your app locally, you should avoid using this command, as it will prevent any new components from being discovered until the cache is cleared or rebuilt.

You can clear the cache at any time without rebuilding it by running `php artisan filament:clear-cached-components`.

#### Caching Blade Icons

If you're not using the [`filament:optimize` command](#optimizing-filament-for-production), you may wish to consider running `php artisan icons:cache` locally, and also in your deployment script. This is because Filament uses the [Blade Icons](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons) package, which can be much more performant when cached.

### Enabling OPcache on your server

To check if [OPcache](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php) is enabled, run:

```bash
php -r "echo 'opcache.enable => ' . ini_get('opcache.enable') . PHP_EOL;"
```

You should see `opcache.enable => 1`. If not, enable it by adding the following line to your `php.ini`:

```ini
opcache.enable=1 # Enable OPcache
```

From the [Laravel Forge documentation](https://forge.laravel.com/docs/servers/php.html#opcache):

<Aside variant="tip">
    Optimizing the PHP OPcache for production will configure OPcache to store your compiled PHP code in memory to greatly improve performance.
</Aside>

Please use a search engine to find the relevant OPcache setup instructions for your environment.

### Optimizing your Laravel app

You should also consider optimizing your Laravel app for production by running `php artisan optimize` in your deployment script. This will cache the configuration files and routes.

## Ensuring assets are up to date

During the Filament installation process, Filament adds the `php artisan filament:upgrade` command to the `composer.json` file, in the `post-autoload-dump` script. This command will ensure that your assets are up to date whenever you download the package.

We strongly suggest that this script remains in your `composer.json` file, otherwise you may run into issues with missing or outdated assets in your production environment. However, if you must remove it, make sure that the command is run manually in your deployment process.

<Aside variant="info">
    If you see anything missing from this guide, please do not hesitate to [make a pull request](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/edit/4.x/docs/14-upgrade-guide.md) to our repository! Any help is appreciated!
</Aside>

## New requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- Laravel v11.28+
- Tailwind CSS v4.0+, if you are currently using Tailwind CSS v3.0 with Filament. This does not apply if you are just using a Filament panel without a custom theme CSS file.
- Filament no longer requires `doctrine/dbal`, but if your application still does, and you do not have it installed directly, you should add it to your `composer.json` file.

## Running the automated upgrade script

<Aside variant="info">
    The upgrade script is not a replacement for the upgrade guide. It handles many small changes that are not mentioned in the upgrade guide, but it does not handle all breaking changes. You should still read the [manual upgrade steps](#breaking-changes-that-must-be-handled-manually) to see what changes you need to make to your code.
</Aside>

<Aside variant="info">
    Some plugins you're using may not be available in v4 just yet. You could temporarily remove them from your `composer.json` file until they've been upgraded, replace them with a similar plugins that are v4-compatible, wait for the plugins to be upgraded before upgrading your app, or even write PRs to help the authors upgrade them.
</Aside>

The first step to upgrade your Filament app is to run the automated upgrade script. This script will automatically upgrade your application to the latest version of Filament and make changes to your code, which handles most breaking changes:

```bash
composer require filament/upgrade:"^4.0" -W --dev

vendor/bin/filament-v4

# Run the commands output by the upgrade script, they are unique to your app
composer require filament/filament:"^4.0" -W --no-update
composer update
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    When using Windows PowerShell to install Filament, you may need to run the command below, since it ignores `^` characters in version constraints:

    ```bash
    composer require filament/upgrade:"~4.0" -W --dev

    vendor/bin/filament-v4

    # Run the commands output by the upgrade script, they are unique to your app
    composer require filament/filament:"^4.0" -W --no-update
    composer update
    ```
</Aside>

<Aside variant="warning">
    If installing the upgrade script fails, make sure that your PHPStan version is at least v2, or your Larastan version is at least v3. The script uses Rector v2, which requires PHPStan v2 or higher.
</Aside>

Make sure to carefully follow the instructions, and review the changes made by the script. You may need to make some manual changes to your code afterwards, but the script should handle most of the repetitive work for you.

Filament v4 introduces a new default directory structure for your Filament resources and clusters. If you are using Filament panels with resources and clusters, you can choose to keep the old directory structure, or migrate to the new one. If you want to migrate to the new directory structure, you can run the following command:

```bash
php artisan filament:upgrade-directory-structure-to-v4 --dry-run
```

The `--dry-run` option will show you what the command would do without actually making any changes. If you are happy with the changes, you can run the command without the `--dry-run` option to apply the changes:

```bash
php artisan filament:upgrade-directory-structure-to-v4
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    This directory upgrade script is not able to perfectly update any references to classes in the same namespace that were present in resource and cluster files, and those references will need to be updated manually after the script has run. You should use tools like [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org) to identify references to classes that are broken after the upgrade.
</Aside>

You can now `composer remove filament/upgrade` as you don't need it anymore.

## Publishing the configuration file

Some changes in Filament v4 can be reverted using the configuration file. If you haven't published the configuration file yet, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-config
```

Firstly, the `default_filesystem_disk` in v4 is set to the `FILESYSTEM_DISK` variable instead of `FILAMENT_FILESYSTEM_DISK`. To preserve the v3 behavior, make sure you use this setting:

```php
return [

    // ...

    'default_filesystem_disk' => env('FILAMENT_FILESYSTEM_DISK', 'public'),

    // ...

]
```

v4 introduces some changes to how Filament generates files. A new `file_generation` section has been added to the v4 configuration file, so that you can revert back to the v3 style if you would like to keep new code consistent with how it looked before upgrading. If your configuration file doesn't already have a `file_generation` section, you should add it yourself, or re-publish the configuration file and tweak it to your liking:

```php
use Filament\Support\Commands\FileGenerators\FileGenerationFlag;

return [

    // ...

    'file_generation' => [
        'flags' => [
            FileGenerationFlag::EMBEDDED_PANEL_RESOURCE_SCHEMAS, // Define new forms and infolists inside the resource class instead of a separate schema class.
            FileGenerationFlag::EMBEDDED_PANEL_RESOURCE_TABLES, // Define new tables inside the resource class instead of a separate table class.
            FileGenerationFlag::PANEL_CLUSTER_CLASSES_OUTSIDE_DIRECTORIES, // Create new cluster classes outside of their directories. Not required if you run `php artisan filament:upgrade-directory-structure-to-v4`.
            FileGenerationFlag::PANEL_RESOURCE_CLASSES_OUTSIDE_DIRECTORIES, // Create new resource classes outside of their directories. Not required if you run `php artisan filament:upgrade-directory-structure-to-v4`.
            FileGenerationFlag::PARTIAL_IMPORTS, // Partially import components such as form fields and table columns instead of importing each component explicitly.
        ],
    ],

    // ...

]
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    The `filament/upgrade` package includes a command to help you move panel resources and clusters to the new directory structure, which is the default in v4:

    ```bash
    php artisan filament:upgrade-directory-structure-to-v4 --dry-run
    ```

    The `--dry-run` option will show you what the command would do without actually making any changes. If you are happy with the changes, you can run the command without the `--dry-run` option to apply the changes:

    ```bash
    php artisan filament:upgrade-directory-structure-to-v4
    ```

    This directory upgrade script is not able to perfectly update any references to classes in the same namespace that were present in resource and cluster files, and those references will need to be updated manually after the script has run. You should use tools like [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org) to identify references to classes that are broken after the upgrade.

    Once you have run the command, you do not need to keep the `FileGenerationFlag::PANEL_CLUSTER_CLASSES_OUTSIDE_DIRECTORIES` or `FileGenerationFlag::PANEL_RESOURCE_CLASSES_OUTSIDE_DIRECTORIES` flags in your configuration file, as the new directory structure is now the default. You can remove them from the `file_generation.flags` array.
</Aside>

### High-impact changes

<Disclosure open x-show="packages.includes('forms') || packages.includes('infolists') || packages.includes('tables')">
<span slot="summary">File visibility is now private by default</span>

In addition to the [default disk being changed to `local`](#publishing-the-configuration-file), the file visibility settings across various components have been changed to `private` instead of `public` by default.

When Filament was first created, Laravel did not have a way to generate temporary signed URLs for local files. As such, the default disk for Filament was set to `public`, and the visibility of file uploads was set to `public` as well to ease the development experience without additional configuration.

However, Laravel 11 introduced a new "Local Temporary URLs" feature which is enabled by default. Users who created their project before this feature was added may have to [update their `config/filesystems.php` file to enable it](https://laravel.com/docs/filesystem#enabling-local-temporary-urls).

In v4, the default disk for Filament is set to `local`, and the visibility of file uploads is set to `private` by default. This means that files are not publicly accessible by default, and you need to generate a temporary signed URL to access them. This change affects the following components:

- `FileUpload` form field, including `SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload`
- `ImageColumn` table column, including `SpatieMediaLibraryImageColumn`
- `ImageEntry` infolist entry, including `SpatieMediaLibraryImageEntry`

<Aside variant="tip">
    You can preserve the old default behavior across your entire app by adding the following code in the `boot()` method of a service provider like `AppServiceProvider`:

    ```php
    use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;
    use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;
    use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
    
    FileUpload::configureUsing(fn (FileUpload $fileUpload) => $fileUpload
        ->visibility('public'));
    
    ImageColumn::configureUsing(fn (ImageColumn $imageColumn) => $imageColumn
        ->visibility('public'));
    
    ImageEntry::configureUsing(fn (ImageEntry $imageEntry) => $imageEntry
        ->visibility('public'));
    ```

@import '../../../../vendor/filament/filament/resources/css/theme.css';

@config 'tailwind.config.js';
```

Now, they should contain this:

```css
@import '../../../../vendor/filament/filament/resources/css/theme.css';

@source '../../../../app/Filament';
@source '../../../../resources/views/filament';
```

This will load Tailwind CSS. The `@source` entries tell Tailwind where to find the classes that are used in your app. You should check the `content` paths in your old `tailwind.config.js` file, and add them as `@source` entries like this. You **don't** need to include `vendor/filament` as a `@source`, but check plugins you have installed to see if they require `@source` entries.

Finally, you should use the [Tailwind upgrade tool](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#using-the-upgrade-tool) to automatically adjust your configuration files to use Tailwind v4, and install Tailwind v4 packages to replace Tailwind v3 ones:

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/upgrade
```

The `tailwind.config.js` file for your theme is no longer used, since Tailwind CSS v4 defines [configuration in CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles). Any customizations you made to the `tailwind.config.js` file should be added to the CSS file.

<span slot="summary">Changes to table filters are deferred by default</span>

The `deferFilters()` method from Filament v3 is now the default behavior in Filament v4, so users must click a button before the filters are applied to the table. To disable this behavior, you can use the `deferFilters(false)` method.

```php

In v3, the `Grid`, `Section` and `Fieldset` layout components consumed the full width of their parent grid by default. This was inconsistent with the behavior of every other component in Filament, which only consumes one column of the grid by default. The intention was to make these components easier to integrate into the default Filament resource form and infolist, which uses a two column grid out of the box.

In v4, the `Grid`, `Section` and `Fieldset` layout components now only consume one column of the grid by default. If you want them to span all columns, you can use the `columnSpanFull()` method:

Last year, the Filament team decided to hand over maintenance of the Spatie Translatable Plugin to the team at [Lara Zeus](https://larazeus.com), who are trusted developers of many Filament plugins. They have maintained a fork of the plugin ever since.

The official Spatie Translatable Plugin will not receive v4 support, and is now deprecated. You can use the [Lara Zeus Translatable Plugin](https://github.com/lara-zeus/spatie-translatable) as a direct replacement. The plugin is compatible with the same version of Spatie Translatable as the official plugin, and has been tested with Filament v4. It also fixes some long-standing bugs in the official plugin.

The [automated upgrade script](#running-the-automated-upgrade-script) suggests commands that uninstall the official plugin and install the Lara Zeus plugin, and replaces any references in your code to the official plugin with the Lara Zeus plugin.

<Disclosure x-show="packages.includes('forms')">
<span slot="summary">Enum field state</span>

In v3, fields that wrote to an enum attribute on a model, such as a `Select`, `CheckboxList` or `Radio` field using `options(Enum::class)`, would inconsistently return the value of the field as either the enum value or the enum instance, depending on whether or not the field was last modified by the server or by the user. This was not useful, and you had to check the type of the value returned by the field to determine if it was an enum value or an enum instance.

In v4, the field state is always returned as the enum instance. This means that you can always use the enum methods on field state. If you were not handling the possibility of the field state being an enum instance in your code previously, you now need to do so.

The following code examples illustrate how field state may now return an enum instance:

```php
use App\Enums\Status;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

Select::make('status')
    ->options(Status::class)
    ->afterStateUpdated(function (?Status $state) {
        // `$state` is now always an instance of `Status`, or `null` if the field is empty.
    });

TextInput::make('...')
    ->afterStateUpdated(function (Get $get) {
        // `$get('status')` is now always an instance of `Status`, or `null` if the field is empty.
    });

$data = $this->form->getState();
// `$data['status']` is now always an instance of `Status`, or `null` if the field is empty.

<span slot="summary">URL parameter names have changed</span>

Filament v4 has renamed some of the URL parameters that are used on resource pages, to make them cleaner in the URL and easier to remember:

- `activeTab` has been renamed to `tab` on List / Manage Relation resource pages.
- `isTableReordering` has been renamed to `reordering` on List / Manage Relation resource pages.

- `tableSearch` has been renamed to `search` on List / Manage Relation resource pages.
- `tableSort` has been renamed to `sort` on List / Manage Relation resource pages.

<span slot="summary">Automatic tenancy global scoping and association</span>

When using tenancy in v3, Filament only scoped resource queries to the current tenant: to render the resource table, resolve URL parameters, and fetch global search results. There were many situations where other queries in the panel were not scoped by default, and the developer had to manually scope them. While this was a documented feature, it created a lot of additional work for developers.

In v4, Filament automatically scopes all queries in a panel to the current tenant, and automatically associates new records with the current tenant using model events. This means that you no longer need to manually scope queries or associate new Eloquent records in most cases. There are still some important points to consider, so the [documentation](users/tenancy#tenancy-security) has been updated to reflect this.

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

## Introduction

"Action" is a word that is used quite a bit within the Laravel community. Traditionally, action PHP classes handle "doing" something in your application's business logic. For instance, logging a user in, sending an email, or creating a new user record in the database.

In Filament, actions also handle "doing" something in your app. However, they are a bit different from traditional actions. They are designed to be used in the context of a user interface. For instance, you might have a button to delete a client record, which opens a modal to confirm your decision. When the user clicks the "Delete" button in the modal, the client is deleted. This whole workflow is an "action".

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('delete')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(fn () => $this->client->delete())
```

Actions can also collect extra information from the user. For instance, you might have a button to email a client. When the user clicks the button, a modal opens to collect the email subject and body. When the user clicks the "Send" button in the modal, the email is sent:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

Action::make('sendEmail')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('subject')->required(),
        RichEditor::make('body')->required(),
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data) {
        Mail::to($this->client)
            ->send(new GenericEmail(
                subject: $data['subject'],
                body: $data['body'],
            ));
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as `$data`, the `action()` function can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

Usually, actions get executed without redirecting the user away from the page. This is because we extensively use Livewire. However, actions can be much simpler, and don't even need a modal. You can pass a URL to an action, and when the user clicks on the button, they are redirected to that page:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `url()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

The entire look of the action's trigger button and the modal is customizable using fluent PHP methods. We provide a sensible and consistent styling for the UI, but all of this is customizable with CSS.

## Available actions

Filament includes several actions that you can add to your app. Their aim is to simplify the most common Eloquent-related actions:

- [Create](create)
- [Edit](edit)
- [View](view)
- [Delete](delete)
- [Replicate](replicate)
- [Force-delete](force-delete)
- [Restore](restore)
- [Import](import)
- [Export](export)

You can also create your own actions to do anything, these are just common ones that we include out of the box.

## Choosing a trigger style

Out of the box, action triggers have 4 styles - "button", "link", "icon button", and "badge".

"Button" triggers have a background color, label, and optionally an [icon](#setting-an-icon). Usually, this is the default button style, but you can use it manually with the `button()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->button()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/button" alt="Button trigger" version="4.x" />

"Link" triggers have no background color. They must have a label and optionally an [icon](#setting-an-icon). They look like a link that you might find embedded within text. You can switch to that style with the `link()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->link()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/link" alt="Link trigger" version="4.x" />

"Icon button" triggers are circular buttons with an [icon](#setting-an-icon) and no label. You can switch to that style with the `iconButton()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-pencil-square')
    ->iconButton()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/icon-button" alt="Icon button trigger" version="4.x" />

"Badge" triggers have a background color, label, and optionally an [icon](#setting-an-icon). You can use a badge as trigger using the `badge()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->badge()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/badge" alt="Badge trigger" version="4.x" />

### Using an icon button on mobile devices only

You may want to use a button style with a label on desktop, but remove the label on mobile. This will transform it into an icon button. You can do this with the `labeledFrom()` method, passing in the responsive [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) at which you want the label to be added to the button:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-pencil-square')
    ->button()
    ->labeledFrom('md')
```

## Setting a label

By default, the label of the trigger button is generated from its name. You may customize this using the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->label('Edit post')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `label()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Setting a color

Buttons may have a [color](../styling/colors) to indicate their significance:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('delete')
    ->color('danger')
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `color()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/danger" alt="Red trigger" version="4.x" />

## Setting a size

Buttons come in 3 sizes - `Size::Small`, `Size::Medium` or `Size::Large`. You can change the size of the action's trigger using the `size()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Size;

Action::make('create')
    ->size(Size::Large)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `size()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/large" alt="Large trigger" version="4.x" />

## Setting an icon

Buttons may have an [icon](../styling/icons) to add more detail to the UI. You can set the icon using the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->icon('heroicon-m-pencil-square')
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `icon()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/icon" alt="Trigger with icon" version="4.x" />

You can also change the icon's position to be after the label instead of before it, using the `iconPosition()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Support\Enums\IconPosition;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->icon('heroicon-m-pencil-square')
    ->iconPosition(IconPosition::After)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `iconPosition()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/icon-after" alt="Trigger with icon after the label" version="4.x" />

## Authorization

You may conditionally show or hide actions for certain users. To do this, you can use either the `visible()` or `hidden()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->visible(auth()->user()->can('update', $this->post))

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->hidden(! auth()->user()->can('update', $this->post))
```

This is useful for authorization of certain actions to only users who have permission.

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `visible()` and `hidden()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Authorization using a policy

You can use a policy to authorize an action. To do this, pass the name of the policy method to the `authorize()` method, and Filament will use the current Eloquent model for that action to find the correct policy:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->authorize('update')
```

<Aside variant="info">
    If you're using an action in a panel resource or relation manager, you don't need to use the `authorize()` method, since Filament will automatically read the policy based on the resource model for the built-in actions like `CreateAction`, `EditAction` and `DeleteAction`. For more information, visit the [resource authorization](../resources/overview#authorization) section.
</Aside>

If your policy method returns a [response message](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#policy-responses), you can disable the action instead of hiding it, and add a tooltip containing the message, using the `authorizationTooltip()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->authorize('update')
    ->authorizationTooltip()
```

You may instead allow the action to still be clickable even if the user is not authorized, but send a notification containing the response message, using the `authorizationNotification()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->authorize('update')
    ->authorizationNotification()
```

### Disabling a button

If you want to disable a button instead of hiding it, you can use the `disabled()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('delete')
    ->disabled()
```

You can conditionally disable a button by passing a boolean to it:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('delete')
    ->disabled(! auth()->user()->can('delete', $this->post))
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `disabled()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Registering keybindings

You can attach keyboard shortcuts to trigger buttons. These use the same key codes as [Mousetrap](https://craig.is/killing/mice):

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('save')
    ->action(fn () => $this->save())
    ->keyBindings(['command+s', 'ctrl+s'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `keyBindings()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Adding a badge to the corner of the button

You can add a badge to the corner of the button, to display whatever you want. It's useful for displaying a count of something, or a status indicator:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('filter')
    ->iconButton()
    ->icon('heroicon-m-funnel')
    ->badge(5)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `badge()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/badged" alt="Trigger with badge" version="4.x" />

You can also pass a [color](../styling/colors) to be used for the badge:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('filter')
    ->iconButton()
    ->icon('heroicon-m-funnel')
    ->badge(5)
    ->badgeColor('success')
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `badgeColor()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/success-badged" alt="Trigger with green badge" version="4.x" />

## Outlined button style

When you're using the "button" trigger style, you might wish to make it less prominent. You could use a different [color](#setting-a-color), but sometimes you might want to make it outlined instead. You can do this with the `outlined()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->button()
    ->outlined()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/outlined" alt="Outlined trigger button" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the label should be hidden or not:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->button()
    ->outlined(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `outlined()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Adding extra HTML attributes to an action

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the action via the `extraAttributes()` method, which will be merged onto its outer HTML element. The attributes should be represented by an array, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->extraAttributes([
        'title' => 'Edit this post',
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `extraAttributes()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="tip">
    By default, calling `extraAttributes()` multiple times will overwrite the previous attributes. If you wish to merge the attributes instead, you can pass `merge: true` to the method.
</Aside>

## Rate limiting actions

You can rate limit actions by using the `rateLimit()` method. This method accepts the number of attempts per minute that a user IP address can make. If the user exceeds this limit, the action will not run and a notification will be shown:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('delete')
    ->rateLimit(5)
```

If the action opens a modal, the rate limit will be applied when the modal is submitted.

If an action is opened with arguments or for a specific Eloquent record, the rate limit will apply to each unique combination of arguments or record for each action. The rate limit is also unique to the current Livewire component / page in a panel.

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `rateLimit()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the rate limited notification

When an action is rate limited, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the rate limit.

To customize the title of this notification, use the `rateLimitedNotificationTitle()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;

DeleteAction::make()
    ->rateLimit(5)
    ->rateLimitedNotificationTitle('Slow down!')
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `rateLimitedNotificationTitle()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

You may customize the entire notification using the `rateLimitedNotification()` method:

```php
use DanHarrin\LivewireRateLimiting\Exceptions\TooManyRequestsException;
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

DeleteAction::make()
    ->rateLimit(5)
    ->rateLimitedNotification(
       fn (TooManyRequestsException $exception): Notification => Notification::make()
            ->warning()
            ->title('Slow down!')
            ->body("You can try deleting again in {$exception->secondsUntilAvailable} seconds."),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x" extras="Exception;;DanHarrin\LivewireRateLimiting\Exceptions\TooManyRequestsException;;$exception;;The exception encountered when the rate limit was hit.||Minutes until available;;int;;$minutes;;The number of minutes until the rate limit will pass.||Seconds until available;;int;;$seconds;;The number of seconds until the rate limit will pass.||Notification;;Filament\Notifications\Notification;;$notification;;The default notification object for the rate limit, which could be a useful starting point for customization.">As well as allowing a static value, the `rateLimitedNotification()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing the rate limit behavior

If you wish to customize the rate limit behavior, you can use Laravel's [rate limiting](https://laravel.com/docs/rate-limiting#basic-usage) features and Filament's [flash notifications](../notifications/overview) together in the action.

If you want to rate limit immediately when an action modal is opened, you can do so in the `mountUsing()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter;

Action::make('delete')
    ->mountUsing(function () {
        if (RateLimiter::tooManyAttempts(
            $rateLimitKey = 'delete:' . auth()->id(),
            maxAttempts: 5,
        )) {
            Notification::make()
                ->title('Too many attempts')
                ->body('Please try again in ' . RateLimiter::availableIn($rateLimitKey) . ' seconds.')
                ->danger()
                ->send();
                
            return;
        }
        
         RateLimiter::hit($rateLimitKey);
    })
```

If you want to rate limit when an action is run, you can do so in the `action()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter;

Action::make('delete')
    ->action(function () {
        if (RateLimiter::tooManyAttempts(
            $rateLimitKey = 'delete:' . auth()->id(),
            maxAttempts: 5,
        )) {
            Notification::make()
                ->title('Too many attempts')
                ->body('Please try again in ' . RateLimiter::availableIn($rateLimitKey) . ' seconds.')
                ->danger()
                ->send();
                
            return;
        }
        
         RateLimiter::hit($rateLimitKey);
        
        // ...
    })
```

## Action utility injection

The vast majority of methods used to configure actions accept functions as parameters instead of hardcoded values:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->label('Edit post')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
```

This alone unlocks many customization possibilities.

The package is also able to inject many utilities to use inside these functions, as parameters. All customization methods that accept functions as arguments can inject utilities.

These injected utilities require specific parameter names to be used. Otherwise, Filament doesn't know what to inject.

### Injecting the current modal form data

If you wish to access the current [modal form data](modals#rendering-a-form-in-a-modal), define a `$data` parameter:

```php
function (array $data) {
    // ...
}
```

Be aware that this will be empty if the modal has not been submitted yet.

### Injecting the Eloquent record

If your action is associated with an Eloquent record, for example if it is on a table row, you can inject the record using a `$record` parameter:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

function (Model $record) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current arguments

If you wish to access the [current arguments](../components/action#passing-action-arguments) that have been passed to the action, define an `$arguments` parameter:

```php
function (array $arguments) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting utilities from a schema

You can access various additional utilities if your action is defined in a schema:

- `$schema` - The schema instance that the action belongs to.
- `$schemaComponent` - The schema component instance that the action belongs to.
- `$schemaComponentState` - The current value of the schema component.
- `$schemaGet` - A function for retrieving values from the schema data. Validation is not run on form fields.
- `$schemaSet` - A function for setting values in the schema data.
- `$schemaOperation` - The current operation being performed by the schema. Usually `create`, `edit`, or `view`.

For more information, please visit the [Schemas section](../schemas/overview#component-utility-injection).

### Injecting the current Livewire component instance

If you wish to access the current Livewire component instance that the action belongs to, define a `$livewire` parameter:

```php
use Livewire\Component;

function (Component $livewire) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current action instance

If you wish to access the current action instance, define a `$action` parameter:

```php
function (Action $action) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting multiple utilities

The parameters are injected dynamically using reflection, so you are able to combine multiple parameters in any order:

```php
use Livewire\Component;

function (array $arguments, Component $livewire) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting dependencies from Laravel's container

You may inject anything from Laravel's container like normal, alongside utilities:

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

function (Request $request, array $arguments) {
    // ...
}
```

## Introduction

Actions may require additional confirmation or input from the user before they run. You may open a modal before an action is executed to do this.

## Confirmation modals

You may require confirmation before an action is run using the `requiresConfirmation()` method. This is useful for particularly destructive actions, such as those that delete records.

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->delete())
    ->requiresConfirmation()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/modal/confirmation" alt="Confirmation modal" version="4.x" />

<Aside variant="warning">
    The confirmation modal is not available when a `url()` is set instead of an `action()`. Instead, you should redirect to the URL within the `action()` closure.
</Aside>

## Controlling modal content

### Customizing the modal's heading, description, and submit action label

You may customize the heading, description and label of the submit button in the modal:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->delete())
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->modalHeading('Delete post')
    ->modalDescription('Are you sure you\'d like to delete this post? This cannot be undone.')
    ->modalSubmitActionLabel('Yes, delete it')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/modal/confirmation-custom-text" alt="Confirmation modal with custom text" version="4.x" />

### Rendering a schema in a modal

Filament allows you to render a [schema](../schemas) in a modal, which allows you to render any of the available components to build a UI. Usually, it is useful to build a form in the schema that can collect extra information from the user before the action runs, but any UI can be rendered:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Action::make('viewUser')
    ->schema([
        Grid::make(2)
            ->schema([
                Section::make('Details')
                    ->schema([
                        TextInput::make('name'),
                        Select::make('position')
                            ->options([
                                'developer' => 'Developer',
                                'designer' => 'Designer',
                            ]),
                        Checkbox::make('is_admin'),
                    ]),
                Section::make('Auditing')
                    ->schema([
                        TextEntry::make('created_at')
                            ->dateTime(),
                        TextEntry::make('updated_at')
                            ->dateTime(),
                    ]),
            ]),
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `schema()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Rendering a form in a modal

You may use [form field](../forms) to create action modal forms. The data from the form is available in the `$data` array of the `action()` closure:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->schema([
        Select::make('authorId')
            ->label('Author')
            ->options(User::query()->pluck('name', 'id'))
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data, Post $record): void {
        $record->author()->associate($data['authorId']);
        $record->save();
    })
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/modal/form" alt="Modal with form" version="4.x" />

##### Filling the form with existing data

You may fill the form with existing data, using the `fillForm()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->fillForm(fn (Post $record): array => [
        'authorId' => $record->author->id,
    ])
    ->schema([
        Select::make('authorId')
            ->label('Author')
            ->options(User::query()->pluck('name', 'id'))
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data, Post $record): void {
        $record->author()->associate($data['authorId']);
        $record->save();
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">The `fillForm()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the data to fill the form with. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

##### Disabling all form fields

You may wish to disable all form fields in the modal, ensuring the user cannot edit them. You may do so using the `disabledForm()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Action::make('approvePost')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('title'),
        Textarea::make('content'),
    ])
    ->disabledForm()
    ->action(function (Post $record): void {
        $record->approve();
    })
```

#### Rendering a wizard in a modal

You may create a [multistep form wizard](../schemas/wizards) inside a modal. Instead of using a `schema()`, define a `steps()` array and pass your `Step` objects:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard\Step;

Action::make('create')
    ->steps([
        Step::make('Name')
            ->description('Give the category a unique name')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('name')
                    ->required()
                    ->live()
                    ->afterStateUpdated(fn ($state, callable $set) => $set('slug', Str::slug($state))),
                TextInput::make('slug')
                    ->disabled()
                    ->required()
                    ->unique(Category::class, 'slug'),
            ])
            ->columns(2),
        Step::make('Description')
            ->description('Add some extra details')
            ->schema([
                MarkdownEditor::make('description'),
            ]),
        Step::make('Visibility')
            ->description('Control who can view it')
            ->schema([
                Toggle::make('is_visible')
                    ->label('Visible to customers.')
                    ->default(true),
            ]),
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/modal/wizard" alt="Modal with wizard" version="4.x" />

### Adding an icon inside the modal

You may add an [icon](../styling/icons) inside the modal using the `modalIcon()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->delete())
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->modalIcon('heroicon-o-trash')
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">The `modalIcon()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/modal/icon" alt="Confirmation modal with icon" version="4.x" />

By default, the icon will inherit the color of the action button. You may customize the color of the icon using the `modalIconColor()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->delete())
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->color('danger')
    ->modalIcon('heroicon-o-trash')
    ->modalIconColor('warning')
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">The `modalIconColor()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing the alignment of modal content

By default, modal content will be aligned to the start, or centered if the modal is `xs` or `sm` in [width](#changing-the-modal-width). If you wish to change the alignment of content in a modal, you can use the `modalAlignment()` method and pass it `Alignment::Start` or `Alignment::Center`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->modalAlignment(Alignment::Center)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">The `modalAlignment()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Making the modal header sticky

The header of a modal scrolls out of view with the modal content when it overflows the modal size. However, slide-overs have a sticky header that's always visible. You may control this behavior using `stickyModalHeader()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->stickyModalHeader()
```

### Making the modal footer sticky

The footer of a modal is rendered inline after the content by default. Slide-overs, however, have a sticky footer that always shows when scrolling the content. You may enable this for a modal too using `stickyModalFooter()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->stickyModalFooter()
```

### Custom modal content

You may define custom content to be rendered inside your modal, which you can specify by passing a Blade view into the `modalContent()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('advance')
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->advance())
    ->modalContent(view('filament.pages.actions.advance'))
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">The `modalContent()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Passing data to the custom modal content

You can pass data to the view by returning it from a function. For example, if the `$record` of an action is set, you can pass that through to the view:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;

Action::make('advance')
    ->action(fn (Contract $record) => $record->advance())
    ->modalContent(fn (Contract $record): View => view(
        'filament.pages.actions.advance',
        ['record' => $record],
    ))
```

#### Adding custom modal content below the form

By default, the custom content is displayed above the modal form if there is one, but you can add content below using `modalContentFooter()` if you wish:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('advance')
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->advance())
    ->modalContentFooter(view('filament.pages.actions.advance'))
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">The `modalContentFooter()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Adding an action to custom modal content

You can add an action button to your custom modal content, which is useful if you want to add a button that performs an action other than the main action. You can do this by registering an action with the `registerModalActions()` method, and then passing it to the view:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;

Action::make('advance')
    ->registerModalActions([
        Action::make('report')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->report()),
    ])
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->advance())
    ->modalContent(fn (Action $action): View => view(
        'filament.pages.actions.advance',
        ['action' => $action],
    ))
```

Now, in the view file, you can render the action button by calling `getModalAction()`:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $action->getModalAction('report') }}
</div>
```

## Using a slide-over instead of a modal

You can open a "slide-over" dialog instead of a modal by using the `slideOver()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->slideOver()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/modal/slide-over" alt="Slide over with form" version="4.x" />

Instead of opening in the center of the screen, the modal content will now slide in from the right and consume the entire height of the browser.

## Changing the modal width

You can change the width of the modal by using the `modalWidth()` method. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `ExtraSmall`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `ExtraLarge`, `TwoExtraLarge`, `ThreeExtraLarge`, `FourExtraLarge`, `FiveExtraLarge`, `SixExtraLarge`, `SevenExtraLarge`, and `Screen`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Width;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->modalWidth(Width::FiveExtraLarge)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">The `modalWidth()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Executing code when the modal opens

You may execute code within a closure when the modal opens, by passing it to the `mountUsing()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

Action::make('create')
    ->mountUsing(function (Schema $form) {
        $form->fill();

        // ...
    })
```

> The `mountUsing()` method, by default, is used by Filament to initialize the [form](#rendering-a-form-in-a-modal). If you override this method, you will need to call `$form->fill()` to ensure the form is initialized correctly. If you wish to populate the form with data, you can do so by passing an array to the `fill()` method, instead of [using `fillForm()` on the action itself](#filling-the-form-with-existing-data).

## Customizing the action buttons in the footer of the modal

By default, there are two actions in the footer of a modal. The first is a button to submit, which executes the `action()`. The second button closes the modal and cancels the action.

### Modifying the default modal footer action button

To modify the action instance that is used to render one of the default action buttons, you may pass a closure to the `modalSubmitAction()` and `modalCancelAction()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('help')
    ->modalContent(view('actions.help'))
    ->modalCancelAction(fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Close'))
```

The [methods available to customize trigger buttons](overview) will work to modify the `$action` instance inside the closure.

<Aside variant="tip">
    To customize the button labels in your modal, the `modalSubmitActionLabel()` and `modalCancelActionLabel()` methods can be used instead of passing a function to `modalSubmitAction()` and `modalCancelAction()`, if you don't require any further customizations.
</Aside>

### Removing a default modal footer action button

To remove a default action, you may pass `false` to either `modalSubmitAction()` or `modalCancelAction()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('help')
    ->modalContent(view('actions.help'))
    ->modalSubmitAction(false)
```

### Adding an extra modal action button to the footer

You may pass an array of extra actions to be rendered, between the default actions, in the footer of the modal using the `extraModalFooterActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('create')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    // ...
    ->extraModalFooterActions(fn (Action $action): array => [
        $action->makeModalSubmitAction('createAnother', arguments: ['another' => true]),
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">The `extraModalFooterActions()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

`$action->makeModalSubmitAction()` returns an action instance that can be customized using the [methods available to customize trigger buttons](overview).

The second parameter of `makeModalSubmitAction()` allows you to pass an array of arguments that will be accessible inside the action's `action()` closure as `$arguments`. These could be useful as flags to indicate that the action should behave differently based on the user's decision:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('create')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    // ...
    ->extraModalFooterActions(fn (Action $action): array => [
        $action->makeModalSubmitAction('createAnother', arguments: ['another' => true]),
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data, array $arguments): void {
        // Create

        if ($arguments['another'] ?? false) {
            // Reset the form and don't close the modal
        }
    })
```

#### Opening another modal from an extra footer action

You can nest actions within each other, allowing you to open a new modal from an extra footer action:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    // ...
    ->extraModalFooterActions([
        Action::make('delete')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(function () {
                // ...
            }),
    ])
```

Now, the edit modal will have a "Delete" button in the footer, which will open a confirmation modal when clicked. This action is completely independent of the `edit` action, and will not run the `edit` action when it is clicked.

In this example though, you probably want to cancel the `edit` action if the `delete` action is run. You can do this using the `cancelParentActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('delete')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->cancelParentActions()
```

If you have deep nesting with multiple parent actions, but you don't want to cancel all of them, you can pass the name of the parent action you want to cancel, including its children, to `cancelParentActions()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('first')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->extraModalFooterActions([
        Action::make('second')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(function () {
                // ...
            })
            ->extraModalFooterActions([
                Action::make('third')
                    ->requiresConfirmation()
                    ->action(function () {
                        // ...
                    })
                    ->extraModalFooterActions([
                        Action::make('fourth')
                            ->requiresConfirmation()
                            ->action(function () {
                                // ...
                            })
                            ->cancelParentActions('second'),
                    ]),
            ]),
    ])
```

In this example, if the `fourth` action is run, the `second` action is canceled, but so is the `third` action since it is a child of `second`. The `first` action is not canceled, however, since it is the parent of `second`. The `first` action's modal will remain open.

## Accessing information about parent actions from a child

You can access the instances of parent actions and their raw data and arguments by injecting the `$mountedActions` array in a function used by your nested action. For example, to get the top-most parent action currently active on the page, you can use `$mountedActions[0]`. From there, you can get the raw data for that action by calling `$mountedActions[0]->getRawData()`. Please be aware that raw data is not validated since the action has not been submitted yet:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Action::make('first')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('foo'),
    ])
    ->action(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->extraModalFooterActions([
        Action::make('second')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(function (array $mountedActions) {
                dd($mountedActions[0]->getRawData());
            
                // ...
            }),
    ])
```

You can do similar with the current arguments for a parent action, with the `$mountedActions[0]->getArguments()` method.

Even if you have multiple layers of nesting, the `$mountedActions` array will contain every action that is currently active, so you can access information about them:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('first')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('foo'),
    ])
    ->action(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->extraModalFooterActions([
        Action::make('second')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('bar'),
            ])
            ->arguments(['number' => 2])
            ->action(function () {
                // ...
            })
            ->extraModalFooterActions([
                Action::make('third')
                    ->schema([
                        TextInput::make('baz'),
                    ])
                    ->arguments(['number' => 3])
                    ->action(function () {
                        // ...
                    })
                    ->extraModalFooterActions([
                        Action::make('fourth')
                            ->requiresConfirmation()
                            ->action(function (array $mountedActions) {
                                dd(
                                    $mountedActions[0]->getRawData(),
                                    $mountedActions[0]->getArguments(),
                                    $mountedActions[1]->getRawData(),
                                    $mountedActions[1]->getArguments(),
                                    $mountedActions[2]->getRawData(),
                                    $mountedActions[2]->getArguments(),
                                );
                                // ...
                            }),
                    ]),
            ]),
    ])
```

## Closing the modal

### Closing the modal by clicking away

By default, when you click away from a modal, it will close itself. If you wish to disable this behavior for a specific action, you can use the `closeModalByClickingAway(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->closeModalByClickingAway(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">The `closeModalByClickingAway()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

If you'd like to change the behavior for all modals in the application, you can do so by calling `Modal::closedByClickingAway()` inside a service provider or middleware:

```php
use Filament\Support\View\Components\ModalComponent;

ModalComponent::closedByClickingAway(false);
```

### Closing the modal by escaping

By default, when you press escape on a modal, it will close itself. If you wish to disable this behavior for a specific action, you can use the `closeModalByEscaping(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->closeModalByEscaping(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">The `closeModalByEscaping()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

If you'd like to change the behavior for all modals in the application, you can do so by calling `Modal::closedByEscaping()` inside a service provider or middleware:

```php
use Filament\Support\View\Components\ModalComponent;

ModalComponent::closedByEscaping(false);
```

### Hiding the modal close button

By default, modals have a close button in the top right corner. If you wish to hide the close button, you can use the `modalCloseButton(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->modalCloseButton(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">The `modalCloseButton()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

If you'd like to hide the close button for all modals in the application, you can do so by calling `Modal::closeButton(false)` inside a service provider or middleware:

```php
use Filament\Support\View\Components\ModalComponent;

ModalComponent::closeButton(false);
```

## Preventing the modal from autofocusing

By default, modals will autofocus on the first focusable element when opened. If you wish to disable this behavior, you can use the `modalAutofocus(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->modalAutofocus(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">The `modalAutofocus()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

If you'd like to disable autofocus for all modals in the application, you can do so by calling `Modal::autofocus(false)` inside a service provider or middleware:

```php
use Filament\Support\View\Components\ModalComponent;

ModalComponent::autofocus(false);
```

## Optimizing modal configuration methods

When you use database queries or other heavy operations inside modal configuration methods like `modalHeading()`, they can be executed more than once. This is because Filament uses these methods to decide whether to render the modal or not, and also to render the modal's content.

To skip the check that Filament does to decide whether to render the modal, you can use the `modal()` method, which will inform Filament that the modal exists for this action, and it does not need to check again:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->modal()
```

## Conditionally hiding the modal

You may have a need to conditionally show a modal for confirmation reasons while falling back to the default action. This can be achieved using `modalHidden()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('create')
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->modalHidden($this->role !== 'admin')
    ->modalContent(view('filament.pages.actions.create'))
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">The `modalHidden()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Adding extra attributes to the modal window

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the modal window via the `extraModalWindowAttributes()` method, which will be merged onto its outer HTML element. The attributes should be represented by an array, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->extraModalWindowAttributes(['class' => 'update-author-modal'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `extraModalWindowAttributes()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="tip">
    By default, calling `extraModalWindowAttributes()` multiple times will overwrite the previous attributes. If you wish to merge the attributes instead, you can pass `merge: true` to the method.

import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

You may group actions together into a dropdown menu by using an `ActionGroup` object. Groups may contain many actions, or other groups:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Actions\ActionGroup;

ActionGroup::make([
    Action::make('view'),
    Action::make('edit'),
    Action::make('delete'),
])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/group/simple" alt="Action group" version="4.x" />

This page is about customizing the look of the group's trigger button and dropdown.

## Customizing the group trigger style

The button which opens the dropdown may be customized in the same way as a normal action. [All the methods available for trigger buttons](overview) may be used to customize the group trigger button:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ActionGroup;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Size;

ActionGroup::make([
    // Array of actions
])
    ->label('More actions')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-ellipsis-vertical')
    ->size(Size::Small)
    ->color('primary')
    ->button()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/group/customized" alt="Action group with custom trigger style" version="4.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/group-button" alt="Table with button action group" version="4.x" />

### Using a grouped button design

Instead of a dropdown, an action group can render itself as a group of buttons. This design works with and without button labels. To use this feature, use the `buttonGroup()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Actions\ActionGroup;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

ActionGroup::make([
    Action::make('edit')
        ->color('gray')
        ->icon(Heroicon::PencilSquare)
        ->hiddenLabel(),
    Action::make('delete')
        ->color('gray')
        ->icon(Heroicon::Trash)
        ->hiddenLabel(),
])
    ->buttonGroup()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/group/button-group" alt="Action group using the button group design" version="4.x" />

## Setting the placement of the dropdown

The dropdown may be positioned relative to the trigger button by using the `dropdownPlacement()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ActionGroup;

ActionGroup::make([
    // Array of actions
])
    ->dropdownPlacement('top-start')
```

<UtilityInjection set="actionGroups" version="4.x">The `dropdownPlacement()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/group/placement" alt="Action group with top placement style" version="4.x" />

## Adding dividers between actions

You may add dividers between groups of actions by using nested `ActionGroup` objects:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ActionGroup;

ActionGroup::make([
    ActionGroup::make([
        // Array of actions
    ])->dropdown(false),
    // Array of actions
])
```

The `dropdown(false)` method puts the actions inside the parent dropdown, instead of a new nested dropdown.

<UtilityInjection set="actionGroups" version="4.x">The `dropdown()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/group/nested" alt="Action groups nested with dividers" version="4.x" />

## Setting the width of the dropdown

The dropdown may be set to a width by using the `dropdownWidth()` method. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `ExtraSmall`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `ExtraLarge`, `TwoExtraLarge`, `ThreeExtraLarge`, `FourExtraLarge`, `FiveExtraLarge`, `SixExtraLarge` and `SevenExtraLarge`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ActionGroup;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Width;

ActionGroup::make([
    // Array of actions
])
    ->dropdownWidth(Width::ExtraSmall)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actionGroups" version="4.x">The `dropdownWidth()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Controlling the dropdown offset

You may control the offset of the dropdown using the `dropdownOffset()` method, by default the offset is set to `8`.

```php
use Filament\Actions\ActionGroup;

ActionGroup::make([
    // Array of actions
])
    ->dropdownOffset(16)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actionGroups" version="4.x">The `dropdownOffset()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Controlling the maximum height of the dropdown

The dropdown content can have a maximum height using the `maxHeight()` method, so that it scrolls. You can pass a [CSS length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length):

```php
use Filament\Actions\ActionGroup;

ActionGroup::make([
    // Array of actions
])
    ->maxHeight('400px')
```

<UtilityInjection set="actionGroups" version="4.x">The `maxHeight()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Introduction

Filament includes an action that is able to create Eloquent records. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal will open with a form inside. The user fills the form, and that data is validated and saved into the database. You may use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

CreateAction::make()
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('title')
            ->required()
            ->maxLength(255),
        // ...
    ])
```

## Customizing data before saving

Sometimes, you may wish to modify form data before it is finally saved to the database. To do this, you may use the `mutateFormDataUsing()` method, which has access to the `$data` as an array, and returns the modified version:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;

CreateAction::make()
    ->mutateDataUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as `$data`, the `mutateDataUsing()` function can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the creation process

You can tweak how the record is created with the `using()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

CreateAction::make()
    ->using(function (array $data, string $model): Model {
        return $model::create($data);
    })
```

`$model` is the class name of the model, but you can replace this with your own hard-coded class if you wish.

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as `$data` and `$model`, the `using()` function can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Redirecting after creation

You may set up a custom redirect when the form is submitted using the `successRedirectUrl()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;

CreateAction::make()
    ->successRedirectUrl(route('posts.list'))
```

If you want to redirect using the created record, use the `$record` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

CreateAction::make()
    ->successRedirectUrl(fn (Model $record): string => route('posts.edit', [
        'post' => $record,
    ]))
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as `$record`, the `successRedirectUrl()` function can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the save notification

When the record is successfully created, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the title of this notification, use the `successNotificationTitle()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;

CreateAction::make()
    ->successNotificationTitle('User registered')
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `successNotificationTitle()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

You may customize the entire notification using the `successNotification()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

CreateAction::make()
    ->successNotification(
       Notification::make()
            ->success()
            ->title('User registered')
            ->body('The user has been created successfully.'),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x" extras="Notification;;Filament\Notifications\Notification;;$notification;;The default notification object, which could be a useful starting point for customization.">As well as allowing a static value, the `successNotification()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

To disable the notification altogether, use the `successNotification(null)` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;

CreateAction::make()
    ->successNotification(null)
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within the action's lifecycle, like before a form is saved.

There are several available hooks:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;

CreateAction::make()
    ->beforeFormFilled(function () {
        // Runs before the form fields are populated with their default values.
    })
    ->afterFormFilled(function () {
        // Runs after the form fields are populated with their default values.
    })
    ->beforeFormValidated(function () {
        // Runs before the form fields are validated when the form is submitted.
    })
    ->afterFormValidated(function () {
        // Runs after the form fields are validated when the form is submitted.
    })
    ->before(function () {
        // Runs before the form fields are saved to the database.
    })
    ->after(function () {
        // Runs after the form fields are saved to the database.
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">These hook functions can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Halting the creation process

At any time, you may call `$action->halt()` from inside a lifecycle hook or mutation method, which will halt the entire creation process:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

CreateAction::make()
    ->before(function (CreateAction $action, Post $record) {
        if (! $record->team->subscribed()) {
            Notification::make()
                ->warning()
                ->title('You don\'t have an active subscription!')
                ->body('Choose a plan to continue.')
                ->persistent()
                ->actions([
                    Action::make('subscribe')
                        ->button()
                        ->url(route('subscribe'), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
                ])
                ->send();
        
            $action->halt();
        }
    })
```

If you'd like the action modal to close too, you can completely `cancel()` the action instead of halting it:

```php
$action->cancel();
```

## Using a wizard

You may easily transform the creation process into a multistep wizard. Instead of using a `schema()`, define a `steps()` array and pass your `Step` objects:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard\Step;

CreateAction::make()
    ->steps([
        Step::make('Name')
            ->description('Give the category a unique name')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('name')
                    ->required()
                    ->live()
                    ->afterStateUpdated(fn ($state, callable $set) => $set('slug', Str::slug($state))),
                TextInput::make('slug')
                    ->disabled()
                    ->required()
                    ->unique(Category::class, 'slug'),
            ])
            ->columns(2),
        Step::make('Description')
            ->description('Add some extra details')
            ->schema([
                MarkdownEditor::make('description'),
            ]),
        Step::make('Visibility')
            ->description('Control who can view it')
            ->schema([
                Toggle::make('is_visible')
                    ->label('Visible to customers.')
                    ->default(true),
            ]),
    ])
```

Now, create a new record to see your wizard in action! Edit will still use the form defined within the resource class.

If you'd like to allow free navigation, so all the steps are skippable, use the `skippableSteps()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;

CreateAction::make()
    ->steps([
        // ...
    ])
    ->skippableSteps()
```

## Creating another record

### Modifying the create another action

If you'd like to modify the "create another" action, you may use the `createAnotherAction()` method, passing a function that returns an action. All methods that are available to [customize action trigger buttons](overview) can be used:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;

CreateAction::make()
    ->createAnotherAction(fn (Action $action): Action => $aciton->label('Custom create another label'))
```

### Disabling create another

If you'd like to remove the "create another" button from the modal, you can use the `createAnother(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;

CreateAction::make()
    ->createAnother(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `createAnother()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Preserving data when creating another

By default, when the user uses the "create and create another" feature, all the form data is cleared so the user can start fresh. If you'd like to preserve some of the data in the form, you may use the `preserveFormDataWhenCreatingAnother()` method, passing an array of fields to preserve:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;

CreateAction::make()
    ->preserveFormDataWhenCreatingAnother(['is_admin', 'organization'])
```

Alternatively, you can define a function that returns an array of the `$data` to preserve:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;
use Illuminate\Support\Arr;

CreateAction::make()
    ->preserveFormDataWhenCreatingAnother(fn (array $data): array => Arr::only($data, ['is_admin', 'organization']))
```

To preserve all the data, return the entire `$data` array:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;

CreateAction::make()
    ->preserveFormDataWhenCreatingAnother(fn (array $data): array => $data)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `preserveFormDataWhenCreatingAnother()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Introduction

Filament includes an action that is able to edit Eloquent records. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal will open with a form inside. The user fills the form, and that data is validated and saved into the database. You may use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\EditAction;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

EditAction::make()
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('title')
            ->required()
            ->maxLength(255),
        // ...
    ])
```

## Customizing data before filling the form

You may wish to modify the data from a record before it is filled into the form. To do this, you may use the `mutateRecordDataUsing()` method to modify the `$data` array, and return the modified version before it is filled into the form:

```php
use Filament\Actions\EditAction;

EditAction::make()
    ->mutateRecordDataUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as `$data`, the `mutateRecordDataUsing()` function can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

        return $data;
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as `$data`, the `mutateDataUsing()` function can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

You can tweak how the record is updated with the `using()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\EditAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

EditAction::make()
    ->using(function (Model $record, array $data): Model {
        $record->update($data);

        return $record;
    })
```

       Notification::make()
            ->success()
            ->title('User updated')
            ->body('The user has been saved successfully.'),
    )

        if (! $record->team->subscribed()) {
            Notification::make()
                ->warning()
                ->title('You don\'t have an active subscription!')
                ->body('Choose a plan to continue.')
                ->persistent()
                ->actions([
                    Action::make('subscribe')
                        ->button()
                        ->url(route('subscribe'), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
                ])
                ->send();
        
            $action->halt();
        }
    })
```

If you'd like the action modal to close too, you can completely `cancel()` the action instead of halting it:

```php
$action->cancel();
```

## Introduction

Filament includes an action that is able to view Eloquent records. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal will open with information inside. Filament uses form fields to structure this information. All form fields are disabled, so they are not editable by the user. You may use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ViewAction;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

ViewAction::make()
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('title')
            ->required()
            ->maxLength(255),
        // ...
    ])
```

        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

title: Delete action
---
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

Filament includes an action that is able to delete Eloquent records. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal asks the user for confirmation. You may use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;

DeleteAction::make()
```

Or if you want to add it as a table bulk action, so that the user can choose which rows to delete, use `Filament\Actions\DeleteBulkAction`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DeleteBulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->toolbarActions([
            DeleteBulkAction::make(),
        ]);
}
```

## Redirecting after deleting

You may set up a custom redirect when the record is deleted using the `successRedirectUrl()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;

DeleteAction::make()
    ->successRedirectUrl(route('posts.list'))
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as `$record`, the `successRedirectUrl()` function can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the delete notification

When the record is successfully deleted, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the title of this notification, use the `successNotificationTitle()` method:

```php

```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `successNotificationTitle()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

DeleteAction::make()
    ->successNotification(
       Notification::make()
            ->success()
            ->title('User deleted')
            ->body('The user has been deleted successfully.'),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x" extras="Notification;;Filament\Notifications\Notification;;$notification;;The default notification object, which could be a useful starting point for customization.">As well as allowing a static value, the `successNotification()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it.

To disable the notification altogether, use the `successNotification(null)` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;

DeleteAction::make()
    ->successNotification(null)
```

## Lifecycle hooks

You can use the `before()` and `after()` methods to execute code before and after a record is deleted:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;

DeleteAction::make()
    ->before(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->after(function () {
        // ...
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">These hook functions can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Improving the performance of delete bulk actions

By default, the `DeleteBulkAction` will load all Eloquent records into memory, before looping over them and deleting them one by one.

If you are deleting a large number of records, you may want to use the `chunkSelectedRecords()` method to fetch a smaller number of records at a time. This will reduce the memory usage of your application:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DeleteBulkAction;

DeleteBulkAction::make()
    ->chunkSelectedRecords(250)
```

Filament loads Eloquent records into memory before deleting them for two reasons:

- To allow individual records in the collection to be authorized with a model policy before deletion (using `authorizeIndividualRecords('delete')`, for example).
- To ensure that model events are run when deleting records, such as the `deleting` and `deleted` events in a model observer.

If you do not require individual record policy authorization and model events, you can use the `fetchSelectedRecords(false)` method, which will not fetch the records into memory before deleting them, and instead will delete them in a single query:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DeleteBulkAction;

DeleteBulkAction::make()
    ->fetchSelectedRecords(false)
```

title: Replicate action
---
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

Filament includes an action that is able to [replicate](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#replicating-models) Eloquent records. You may use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;

ReplicateAction::make()
```

## Excluding attributes

The `excludeAttributes()` method is used to instruct the action which columns should be excluded from replication:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;

ReplicateAction::make()
    ->excludeAttributes(['slug'])
```

## Customizing data before filling the form

You may wish to modify the data from a record before it is filled into the form. To do this, you may use the `mutateRecordDataUsing()` method to modify the `$data` array, and return the modified version before it is filled into the form:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;

ReplicateAction::make()
    ->mutateRecordDataUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

## Redirecting after replication

You may set up a custom redirect when the form is submitted using the `successRedirectUrl()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;

ReplicateAction::make()
    ->successRedirectUrl(route('posts.list'))
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x" extras="Replica Eloquent record;;Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;;$replica;;The Eloquent model instance that was just created as a replica of the original record.">As well as `$record`, the `successRedirectUrl()` function can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the replicate notification

When the record is successfully replicated, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the title of this notification, use the `successNotificationTitle()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;

ReplicateAction::make()
    ->successNotificationTitle('Category replicated')
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x" extras="Replica Eloquent record;;Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;;$replica;;The Eloquent model instance that was just created as a replica of the original record.">As well as allowing a static value, the `successNotificationTitle()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

You may customize the entire notification using the `successNotification()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

ReplicateAction::make()
    ->successNotification(
       Notification::make()
            ->success()
            ->title('Category replicated')
            ->body('The category has been replicated successfully.'),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x" extras="Notification;;Filament\Notifications\Notification;;$notification;;The default notification object, which could be a useful starting point for customization.||Replica Eloquent record;;Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;;$replica;;The Eloquent model instance that was just created as a replica of the original record.">As well as allowing a static value, the `successNotification()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

To disable the notification altogether, use the `successNotification(null)` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\RestoreAction;

ReplicateAction::make()
    ->successNotification(null)
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within the action's lifecycle, like before the replica is saved.

```php
use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

ReplicateAction::make()
    ->before(function () {
        // Runs before the record has been replicated.
    })
    ->beforeReplicaSaved(function (Model $replica): void {
        // Runs after the record has been replicated but before it is saved to the database.
    })
    ->after(function (Model $replica): void {
        // Runs after the replica has been saved to the database.
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x" extras="Replica Eloquent record;;Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;;$replica;;The Eloquent model instance that was just created as a replica of the original record.">These hook functions can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Halting the replication process

At any time, you may call `$action->halt()` from inside a lifecycle hook, which will halt the entire replication process:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

ReplicateAction::make()
    ->before(function (ReplicateAction $action, Post $record) {
        if (! $record->team->subscribed()) {
            Notification::make()
                ->warning()
                ->title('You don\'t have an active subscription!')
                ->body('Choose a plan to continue.')
                ->persistent()
                ->actions([
                    Action::make('subscribe')
                        ->button()
                        ->url(route('subscribe'), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
                ])
                ->send();
        
            $action->halt();
        }
    })
```

If you'd like the action modal to close too, you can completely `cancel()` the action instead of halting it:

```php
$action->cancel();
```

title: Force-delete action
---
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

Filament includes an action that is able to force-delete [soft-deleted](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#soft-deleting) Eloquent records. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal asks the user for confirmation. You may use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteAction;

ForceDeleteAction::make()
```

Or if you want to add it as a table bulk action, so that the user can choose which rows to force-delete, use `Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteBulkAction`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteBulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->toolbarActions([
            ForceDeleteBulkAction::make(),
        ]);
}
```

## Redirecting after force-deleting

You may set up a custom redirect when the form is submitted using the `successRedirectUrl()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteAction;

ForceDeleteAction::make()
    ->successRedirectUrl(route('posts.list'))
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as `$record`, the `successRedirectUrl()` function can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the force-delete notification

When the record is successfully force-deleted, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the title of this notification, use the `successNotificationTitle()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteAction;

ForceDeleteAction::make()
    ->successNotificationTitle('User force-deleted')
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `successNotificationTitle()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

You may customize the entire notification using the `successNotification()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteAction;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

ForceDeleteAction::make()
    ->successNotification(
       Notification::make()
            ->success()
            ->title('User force-deleted')
            ->body('The user has been force-deleted successfully.'),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x" extras="Notification;;Filament\Notifications\Notification;;$notification;;The default notification object, which could be a useful starting point for customization.">As well as allowing a static value, the `successNotification()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

To disable the notification altogether, use the `successNotification(null)` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteAction;

ForceDeleteAction::make()
    ->successNotification(null)
```

## Lifecycle hooks

You can use the `before()` and `after()` methods to execute code before and after a record is force-deleted:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteAction;

ForceDeleteAction::make()
    ->before(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->after(function () {
        // ...
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">These hook functions can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Improving the performance of force-delete bulk actions

By default, the `ForceDeleteBulkAction` will load all Eloquent records into memory, before looping over them and deleting them one by one.

If you are deleting a large number of records, you may want to use the `chunkSelectedRecords()` method to fetch a smaller number of records at a time. This will reduce the memory usage of your application:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteBulkAction;

ForceDeleteBulkAction::make()
    ->chunkSelectedRecords(250)
```

Filament loads Eloquent records into memory before deleting them for two reasons:

- To allow individual records in the collection to be authorized with a model policy before deletion (using `authorizeIndividualRecords('forceDelete')`, for example).
- To ensure that model events are run when deleting records, such as the `forceDeleting` and `forceDeleted` events in a model observer.

If you do not require individual record policy authorization and model events, you can use the `fetchSelectedRecords(false)` method, which will not fetch the records into memory before deleting them, and instead will delete them in a single query:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteBulkAction;

ForceDeleteBulkAction::make()
    ->fetchSelectedRecords(false)
```

title: Import action
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

Filament includes an action that is able to import rows from a CSV. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal asks the user for a file. Once they upload one, they are able to map each column in the CSV to a real column in the database. If any rows fail validation, they will be compiled into a downloadable CSV for the user to review after the rest of the rows have been imported. Users can also download an example CSV file containing all the columns that can be imported.

This feature uses [job batches](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#job-batching) and [database notifications](../../notifications/database-notifications), so you need to publish those migrations from Laravel. Also, you need to publish the migrations for tables that Filament uses to store information about imports:

```bash
# Laravel 11 and higher
php artisan make:queue-batches-table
php artisan make:notifications-table

# Laravel 10
php artisan queue:batches-table
php artisan notifications:table
```

```bash
# All apps
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-actions-migrations
php artisan migrate
```

<Aside variant="info">
    If you're using PostgreSQL, make sure that the `data` column in the notifications migration is using `json()`: `$table->json('data')`.
</Aside>

<Aside variant="info">
    If you're using UUIDs for your `User` model, make sure that your `notifiable` column in the notifications migration is using `uuidMorphs()`: `$table->uuidMorphs('notifiable')`.
</Aside>

You may use the `ImportAction` like so:

```php
use App\Filament\Imports\ProductImporter;
use Filament\Actions\ImportAction;

ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
```

If you want to add this action to the header of a table, you may do so like this:

```php
use App\Filament\Imports\ProductImporter;
use Filament\Actions\ImportAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->headerActions([
            ImportAction::make()
                ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
        ]);
}
```

The ["importer" class needs to be created](#creating-an-importer) to tell Filament how to import each row of the CSV.

If you have more than one `ImportAction` in the same place, you should give each a unique name in the `make()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ImportAction;

ImportAction::make('importProducts')
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)

ImportAction::make('importBrands')
    ->importer(BrandImporter::class)
```

## Creating an importer

To create an importer class for a model, you may use the `make:filament-importer` command, passing the name of a model:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-importer Product
```

This will create a new class in the `app/Filament/Imports` directory. You now need to define the [columns](#defining-importer-columns) that can be imported.

### Automatically generating importer columns

If you'd like to save time, Filament can automatically generate the [columns](#defining-importer-columns) for you, based on your model's database columns, using `--generate`:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-importer Product --generate
```

## Defining importer columns

To define the columns that can be imported, you need to override the `getColumns()` method on your importer class, returning an array of `ImportColumn` objects:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

public static function getColumns(): array
{
    return [
        ImportColumn::make('name')
            ->requiredMapping()
            ->rules(['required', 'max:255']),
        ImportColumn::make('sku')
            ->label('SKU')
            ->requiredMapping()
            ->rules(['required', 'max:32']),
        ImportColumn::make('price')
            ->numeric()
            ->rules(['numeric', 'min:0']),
    ];
}
```

### Customizing the label of an import column

The label for each column will be generated automatically from its name, but you can override it by calling the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->label('SKU')
```

### Requiring an importer column to be mapped to a CSV column

You can call the `requiredMapping()` method to make a column required to be mapped to a column in the CSV. Columns that are required in the database should be required to be mapped:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->requiredMapping()
```

If you require a column in the database, you also need to make sure that it has a [`rules(['required'])` validation rule](#validating-csv-data).

If a column is not mapped, it will not be validated since there is no data to validate.

If you allow an import to create records as well as [update existing ones](#updating-existing-records-when-importing), but only require a column to be mapped when creating records as it's a required field, you can use the `requiredMappingForNewRecordsOnly()` method instead of `requiredMapping()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->requiredMappingForNewRecordsOnly()
```

If the `resolveRecord()` method returns a model instance that is not saved in the database yet, the column will be required to be mapped, just for that row. If the user does not map the column, and one of the rows in the import does not yet exist in the database, just that row will fail and a message will be added to the failed rows CSV after every row has been analyzed.

### Validating CSV data

You can call the `rules()` method to add validation rules to a column. These rules will check the data in each row from the CSV before it is saved to the database:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->rules(['required', 'max:32'])
```

Any rows that do not pass validation will not be imported. Instead, they will be compiled into a new CSV of "failed rows", which the user can download after the import has finished. The user will be shown a list of validation errors for each row that failed.

<UtilityInjection set="importColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `rules()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Casting state

Before [validation](#validating-csv-data), data from the CSV can be cast. This is useful for converting strings into the correct data type, otherwise validation may fail. For example, if you have a `price` column in your CSV, you may want to cast it to a float:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('price')
    ->castStateUsing(function (string $state): ?float {
        if (blank($state)) {
            return null;
        }
        
        $state = preg_replace('/[^0-9.]/', '', $state);
        $state = floatval($state);
    
        return round($state, precision: 2);
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="importColumns" version="4.x" extras="State;;mixed;;$state;;The state to cast, after it has been processed by other casting methods.||Original state;;mixed;;$originalState;;The state to cast, before it was processed by other casting methods.">As well as `$state`, the `castStateUsing()` method allows you to inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

In this example, we pass in a function that is used to cast the `$state`. This function removes any non-numeric characters from the string, casts it to a float, and rounds it to two decimal places.

<Aside variant="info">
    If a column is not [required by validation](#validating-csv-data), and it is empty, it will not be cast.
</Aside>

Filament also ships with some built-in casting methods:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('price')
    ->numeric() // Casts the state to a float.

ImportColumn::make('price')
    ->numeric(decimalPlaces: 2) // Casts the state to a float, and rounds it to 2 decimal places.

ImportColumn::make('quantity')
    ->integer() // Casts the state to an integer.

ImportColumn::make('is_visible')
    ->boolean() // Casts the state to a boolean.
```

#### Mutating the state after it has been cast

If you're using a [built-in casting method](#casting-state) or [array cast](#handling-multiple-values-in-a-single-column), you can mutate the state after it has been cast by passing a function to the `castStateUsing()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('price')
    ->numeric()
    ->castStateUsing(function (float $state): ?float {
        if (blank($state)) {
            return null;
        }
    
        return round($state * 100);
    })
```

You can even access the original state before it was cast, by defining an `$originalState` argument in the function:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('price')
    ->numeric()
    ->castStateUsing(function (float $state, mixed $originalState): ?float {
        // ...
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="importColumns" version="4.x" extras="State;;mixed;;$state;;The state to cast, after it has been processed by other casting methods.||Original state;;mixed;;$originalState;;The state to cast, before it was processed by other casting methods.">As well as `$state`, the `castStateUsing()` method allows you to inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Handling multiple values in a single column

You may use the `multiple()` method to cast the values in a column to an array. It accepts a delimiter as its first argument, which is used to split the values in the column into an array. For example, if you have a `documentation_urls` column in your CSV, you may want to cast it to an array of URLs:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('documentation_urls')
    ->multiple(',')
```

<UtilityInjection set="importColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `multiple()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

In this example, we pass in a comma as the delimiter, so the values in the column will be split by commas, and cast to an array.

#### Casting each item in an array

If you want to cast each item in the array to a different data type, you can chain the [built-in casting methods](#casting-state):

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('customer_ratings')
    ->multiple(',')
    ->integer() // Casts each item in the array to an integer.
```

#### Validating each item in an array

If you want to validate each item in the array, you can chain the `nestedRecursiveRules()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('customer_ratings')
    ->multiple(',')
    ->integer()
    ->rules(['array'])
    ->nestedRecursiveRules(['integer', 'min:1', 'max:5'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="importColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `nestedRecursiveRules()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Importing relationships

You may use the `relationship()` method to import a relationship. At the moment, `BelongsTo` and `BelongsToMany` relationships are supported. For example, if you have a `category` column in your CSV, you may want to import the category `BelongsTo` relationship:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('author')
    ->relationship()
```

In this example, the `author` column in the CSV will be mapped to the `author_id` column in the database. The CSV should contain the primary keys of authors, usually `id`.

If the column has a value, but the author cannot be found, the import will fail validation. Filament automatically adds validation to all relationship columns, to ensure that the relationship is not empty when it is required.

If you want to import a `BelongsToMany` relationship, make sure that the column is set to [`multiple()`](#handling-multiple-values-in-a-single-column), with the correct separator between values:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('authors')
    ->relationship()
    ->multiple(',')
```

#### Customizing the relationship import resolution

If you want to find a related record using a different column, you can pass the column name as `resolveUsing`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('author')
    ->relationship(resolveUsing: 'email')
```

You can pass in multiple columns to `resolveUsing`, and they will be used to find the author, in an "or" fashion. For example, if you pass in `['email', 'username']`, the record can be found by either their email or username:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('author')
    ->relationship(resolveUsing: ['email', 'username'])
```

You can also customize the resolution process, by passing in a function to `resolveUsing`, which should return a record to associate with the relationship:

```php
use App\Models\Author;
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('author')
    ->relationship(resolveUsing: function (string $state): ?Author {
        return Author::query()
            ->where('email', $state)
            ->orWhere('username', $state)
            ->first();
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="importColumns" version="4.x" extras="State;;mixed;;$state;;The state to resolve into a record.">The function passed to `resolveUsing` allows you to inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

If you are using a `BelongsToMany` relationship, the `$state` will be an array, and you should return a collection of records that you have resolved:

```php
use App\Models\Author;
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

ImportColumn::make('authors')
    ->relationship(resolveUsing: function (array $states): Collection {
        return Author::query()
            ->whereIn('email', $states)
            ->orWhereIn('username', $states)
            ->get();
    })
```

You could even use this function to dynamically determine which columns to use to resolve the record:

```php
use App\Models\Author;
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('author')
    ->relationship(resolveUsing: function (string $state): ?Author {
        if (filter_var($state, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
            return 'email';
        }
    
        return 'username';
    })
```

### Marking column data as sensitive

When import rows fail validation, they are logged to the database, ready for export when the import completes. You may want to exclude certain columns from this logging to avoid storing sensitive data in plain text. To achieve this, you can use the `sensitive()` method on the `ImportColumn` to prevent its data from being logged:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('ssn')
    ->label('Social security number')
    ->sensitive()
    ->rules(['required', 'digits:9'])
```

### Customizing how a column is filled into a record

If you want to customize how column state is filled into a record, you can pass a function to the `fillRecordUsing()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Product;
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->fillRecordUsing(function (Product $record, string $state): void {
        $record->sku = strtoupper($state);
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="importColumns" version="4.x" extras="State;;mixed;;$state;;The state to fill into the record.">The function passed to the `fillRecordUsing()` method allows you to inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Adding helper text below the import column

Sometimes, you may wish to provide extra information for the user before validation. You can do this by adding `helperText()` to a column, which gets displayed below the mapping select:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('skus')
    ->multiple(',')
    ->helperText('A comma-separated list of SKUs.')
```

## Updating existing records when importing

When generating an importer class, you will see this `resolveRecord()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Product;

public function resolveRecord(): ?Product
{
    // return Product::firstOrNew([
    //     // Update existing records, matching them by `$this->data['column_name']`
    //     'email' => $this->data['email'],
    // ]);

    return new Product();
}
```

This method is called for each row in the CSV, and is responsible for returning a model instance that will be filled with the data from the CSV, and saved to the database. By default, it will create a new record for each row. However, you can customize this behavior to update existing records instead. For example, you might want to update a product if it already exists, and create a new one if it doesn't. To do this, you can uncomment the `firstOrNew()` line, and pass the column name that you want to match on. For a product, we might want to match on the `sku` column:

```php
use App\Models\Product;

public function resolveRecord(): ?Product
{
    return Product::firstOrNew([
        'sku' => $this->data['sku'],
    ]);
}
```

### Updating existing records when importing only

If you want to write an importer that only updates existing records, and does not create new ones, you can return `null` if no record is found:

```php
use App\Models\Product;

public function resolveRecord(): ?Product
{
    return Product::query()
        ->where('sku', $this->data['sku'])
        ->first();
}
```

If you'd like to fail the import row if no record is found, you can throw a `RowImportFailedException` with a message:

```php
use App\Models\Product;
use Filament\Actions\Imports\Exceptions\RowImportFailedException;

public function resolveRecord(): ?Product
{
    $product = Product::query()
        ->where('sku', $this->data['sku'])
        ->first();

    if (! $product) {
        throw new RowImportFailedException("No product found with SKU [{$this->data['sku']}].");
    }

    return $product;
}
```

When the import is completed, the user will be able to download a CSV of failed rows, which will contain the error messages.

### Ignoring blank state for an import column

By default, if a column in the CSV is blank, and mapped by the user, and it's not required by validation, the column will be imported as `null` in the database. If you'd like to ignore blank state, and use the existing value in the database instead, you can call the `ignoreBlankState()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('price')
    ->ignoreBlankState()
```

## Using import options

The import action can render extra form components that the user can interact with when importing a CSV. This can be useful to allow the user to customize the behavior of the importer. For instance, you might want a user to be able to choose whether to update existing records when importing, or only create new ones. To do this, you can return options form components from the `getOptionsFormComponents()` method on your importer class:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

public static function getOptionsFormComponents(): array
{
    return [
        Checkbox::make('updateExisting')
            ->label('Update existing records'),
    ];
}
```

Alternatively, you can pass a set of static options to the importer through the `options()` method on the action:

```php
use App\Filament\Imports\ProductImporter;
use Filament\Actions\ImportAction;

ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->options([
        'updateExisting' => true,
    ])
```

Now, you can access the data from these options inside the importer class, by calling `$this->options`. For example, you might want to use it inside `resolveRecord()` to [update an existing product](#updating-existing-records-when-importing):

```php
use App\Models\Product;

public function resolveRecord(): ?Product
{
    if ($this->options['updateExisting'] ?? false) {
        return Product::firstOrNew([
            'sku' => $this->data['sku'],
        ]);
    }

    return new Product();
}
```

## Improving import column mapping guesses

By default, Filament will attempt to "guess" which columns in the CSV match which columns in the database, to save the user time. It does this by attempting to find different combinations of the column name, with spaces, `-`, `_`, all cases insensitively. However, if you'd like to improve the guesses, you can call the `guess()` method with more examples of the column name that could be present in the CSV:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->guess(['id', 'number', 'stock-keeping unit'])
```

## Providing example CSV data

Before the user uploads a CSV, they have an option to download an example CSV file, containing all the available columns that can be imported. This is useful, as it allows the user to import this file directly into their spreadsheet software, and fill it out.

You can also add an example row to the CSV, to show the user what the data should look like. To fill in this example row, you can pass in an example column value to the `example()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->example('ABC123')
```

Or if you want to add more than one example row, you can pass an array to the `examples()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->examples(['ABC123', 'DEF456'])
```

By default, the name of the column is used in the header of the example CSV. You can customize the header per-column using `exampleHeader()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->exampleHeader('SKU')
```

## Using a custom user model

By default, the `imports` table has a `user_id` column. That column is constrained to the `users` table:

```php
$table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained()->cascadeOnDelete();
```

In the `Import` model, the `user()` relationship is defined as a `BelongsTo` relationship to the `App\Models\User` model. If the `App\Models\User` model does not exist, or you want to use a different one, you can bind a new `Authenticatable` model to the container in a service provider's `register()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Admin;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable;

$this->app->bind(Authenticatable::class, Admin::class);
```

If your authenticatable model uses a different table to `users`, you should pass that table name to `constrained()`:

```php
$table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained('admins')->cascadeOnDelete();
```

### Using a polymorphic user relationship

If you want to associate imports with multiple user models, you can use a polymorphic `MorphTo` relationship instead. To do this, you need to replace the `user_id` column in the `imports` table:

```php
$table->morphs('user');
```

Then, in a service provider's `boot()` method, you should call `Import::polymorphicUserRelationship()` to swap the `user()` relationship on the `Import` model to a `MorphTo` relationship:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\Models\Import;

Import::polymorphicUserRelationship();
```

## Limiting the maximum number of rows that can be imported

To prevent server overload, you may wish to limit the maximum number of rows that can be imported from one CSV file. You can do this by calling the `maxRows()` method on the action:

```php
use App\Filament\Imports\ProductImporter;
use Filament\Actions\ImportAction;

ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->maxRows(100000)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `maxRows()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Changing the import chunk size

Filament will chunk the CSV, and process each chunk in a different queued job. By default, chunks are 100 rows at a time. You can change this by calling the `chunkSize()` method on the action:

```php
use App\Filament\Imports\ProductImporter;
use Filament\Actions\ImportAction;

ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->chunkSize(250)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `chunkSize()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="tip">
    If you are encountering memory or timeout issues when importing large CSV files, you may wish to reduce the chunk size.
</Aside>

## Changing the CSV delimiter

The default delimiter for CSVs is the comma (`,`). If your import uses a different delimiter, you may call the `csvDelimiter()` method on the action, passing a new one:

```php
use App\Filament\Imports\ProductImporter;
use Filament\Actions\ImportAction;

ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->csvDelimiter(';')
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `csvDelimiter()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

You can only specify a single character, otherwise an exception will be thrown.

## Changing the column header offset

If your column headers are not on the first row of the CSV, you can call the `headerOffset()` method on the action, passing the number of rows to skip:

```php
use App\Filament\Imports\ProductImporter;
use Filament\Actions\ImportAction;

ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->headerOffset(5)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `headerOffset()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the import job

The default job for processing imports is `Filament\Actions\Imports\Jobs\ImportCsv`. If you want to extend this class and override any of its methods, you may replace the original class in the `register()` method of a service provider:

```php
use App\Jobs\ImportCsv;
use Filament\Actions\Imports\Jobs\ImportCsv as BaseImportCsv;

$this->app->bind(BaseImportCsv::class, ImportCsv::class);
```

Or, you can pass the new job class to the `job()` method on the action, to customize the job for a specific import:

```php
use App\Filament\Imports\ProductImporter;
use App\Jobs\ImportCsv;
use Filament\Actions\ImportAction;

ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->job(ImportCsv::class)
```

### Customizing the import queue and connection

By default, the import system will use the default queue and connection. If you'd like to customize the queue used for jobs of a certain importer, you may override the `getJobQueue()` method in your importer class:

```php
public function getJobQueue(): ?string
{
    return 'imports';
}
```

You can also customize the connection used for jobs of a certain importer, by overriding the `getJobConnection()` method in your importer class:

```php
public function getJobConnection(): ?string
{
    return 'sqs';
}
```

### Customizing the import job middleware

By default, the import system will only process one job at a time from each import. This is to prevent the server from being overloaded, and other jobs from being delayed by large imports. That functionality is defined in the `WithoutOverlapping` middleware on the importer class:

```php
use Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\WithoutOverlapping;

public function getJobMiddleware(): array
{
    return [
        (new WithoutOverlapping("import{$this->import->getKey()}"))->expireAfter(600),
    ];
}
```

If you'd like to customize the middleware that is applied to jobs of a certain importer, you may override this method in your importer class. You can read more about job middleware in the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#job-middleware).

### Customizing the import job retries

By default, the import system will retry a job for 24 hours, or until it fails 5 times with unhandled exceptions, whichever happens first. This is to allow for temporary issues, such as the database being unavailable, to be resolved. You may change the time period for the job to retry, which is defined in the `getJobRetryUntil()` method on the exporter class:

```php
use Carbon\CarbonInterface;

public function getJobRetryUntil(): ?CarbonInterface
{
    return now()->addHours(12);
}
```

You can read more about job retries in the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#max-job-attempts-and-timeout).

#### Customizing the import job backoff strategy

By default, the import system will wait 1 minute, then 2 minutes, then 5 minutes, then 10 minutes thereafter, before retrying a job. This is to prevent the server from being overloaded by a job that is failing repeatedly. That functionality is defined in the `getJobBackoff()` method on the importer class:

```php
/**
* @return int | array<int> | null
 */
public function getJobBackoff(): int | array | null
{
    return [60, 120, 300, 600];
}
```

You can read more about job backoff, including how to configure exponential backoffs, in the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#dealing-with-failed-jobs).

### Customizing the import job tags

By default, the import system will tag each job with the ID of the import. This is to allow you to easily find all jobs related to a certain import. That functionality is defined in the `getJobTags()` method on the importer class:

```php
public function getJobTags(): array
{
    return ["import{$this->import->getKey()}"];
}
```

If you'd like to customize the tags that are applied to jobs of a certain importer, you may override this method in your importer class.

### Customizing the import job batch name

By default, the import system doesn't define any name for the job batches. If you'd like to customize the name that is applied to job batches of a certain importer, you may override the `getJobBatchName()` method in your importer class:

```php
public function getJobBatchName(): ?string
{
    return 'product-import';
}
```

## Customizing import validation messages

The import system will automatically validate the CSV file before it is imported. If there are any errors, the user will be shown a list of them, and the import will not be processed. If you'd like to override any default validation messages, you may do so by overriding the `getValidationMessages()` method on your importer class:

```php
public function getValidationMessages(): array
{
    return [
        'name.required' => 'The name column must not be empty.',
    ];
}
```

To learn more about customizing validation messages, read the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#customizing-the-error-messages).

### Customizing import validation attributes

When columns fail validation, their label is used in the error message. To customize the label used in field error messages, use the `validationAttribute()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('name')
    ->validationAttribute('full name')
```

## Customizing import file validation

You can add new [Laravel validation rules](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#available-validation-rules) for the import file using the `fileRules()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ImportAction;
use Illuminate\Validation\Rules\File;

ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->fileRules([
        'max:1024',
        // or
        File::types(['csv', 'txt'])->max(1024),
    ]),
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `fileRules()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within an importer's lifecycle, like before a record is saved. To set up a hook, create a protected method on the importer class with the name of the hook:

```php
protected function beforeSave(): void
{
    // ...
}
```

In this example, the code in the `beforeSave()` method will be called before the validated data from the CSV is saved to the database.

There are several available hooks for importers:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\Importer;

class ProductImporter extends Importer
{
    // ...

    protected function beforeValidate(): void
    {
        // Runs before the CSV data for a row is validated.
    }

    protected function afterValidate(): void
    {
        // Runs after the CSV data for a row is validated.
    }

    protected function beforeFill(): void
    {
        // Runs before the validated CSV data for a row is filled into a model instance.
    }

    protected function afterFill(): void
    {
        // Runs after the validated CSV data for a row is filled into a model instance.
    }

    protected function beforeSave(): void
    {
        // Runs before a record is saved to the database.
    }

    protected function beforeCreate(): void
    {
        // Similar to `beforeSave()`, but only runs when creating a new record.
    }

    protected function beforeUpdate(): void
    {
        // Similar to `beforeSave()`, but only runs when updating an existing record.
    }

    protected function afterSave(): void
    {
        // Runs after a record is saved to the database.
    }
    
    protected function afterCreate(): void
    {
        // Similar to `afterSave()`, but only runs when creating a new record.
    }
    
    protected function afterUpdate(): void
    {
        // Similar to `afterSave()`, but only runs when updating an existing record.
    }
}
```

Inside these hooks, you can access the current row's data using `$this->data`. You can also access the original row of data from the CSV, before it was [cast](#casting-state) or mapped, using `$this->originalData`.

The current record (if it exists yet) is accessible in `$this->record`, and the [import form options](#using-import-options) using `$this->options`.

## Authorization

By default, only the user who started the import may access the failure CSV file that gets generated if part of an import fails. If you'd like to customize the authorization logic, you may create an `ImportPolicy` class, and [register it in your `AuthServiceProvider`](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#registering-policies):

```php
use App\Policies\ImportPolicy;
use Filament\Actions\Imports\Models\Import;

protected $policies = [
    Import::class => ImportPolicy::class,
];
```

The `view()` method of the policy will be used to authorize access to the failure CSV file.

Please note that if you define a policy, the existing logic of ensuring only the user who started the import can access the failure CSV file will be removed. You will need to add that logic to your policy if you want to keep it:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Actions\Imports\Models\Import;

public function view(User $user, Import $import): bool
{
    return $import->user()->is($user);
}
```

## Introduction

Filament includes an action that is able to export rows to a CSV or XLSX file. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal asks for the columns that they want to export, and what they should be labeled. This feature uses [job batches](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#job-batching) and [database notifications](../../notifications/database-notifications), so you need to publish those migrations from Laravel. Also, you need to publish the migrations for tables that Filament uses to store information about exports:

```bash
# Laravel 11 and higher
php artisan make:queue-batches-table
php artisan make:notifications-table

# Laravel 10
php artisan queue:batches-table
php artisan notifications:table
```

```bash
# All apps
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-actions-migrations
php artisan migrate
```

<Aside variant="info">
    If you're using PostgreSQL, make sure that the `data` column in the notifications migration is using `json()`: `$table->json('data')`.
</Aside>

<Aside variant="info">
    If you're using UUIDs for your `User` model, make sure that your `notifiable` column in the notifications migration is using `uuidMorphs()`: `$table->uuidMorphs('notifiable')`.
</Aside>

You may use the `ExportAction` like so:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
```

If you want to add this action to the header of a table, you may do so like this:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->headerActions([
            ExportAction::make()
                ->exporter(ProductExporter::class),
        ]);
}
```

Or if you want to add it as a table bulk action, so that the user can choose which rows to export, they can use `Filament\Actions\ExportBulkAction`:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Actions\ExportBulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->toolbarActions([
            ExportBulkAction::make()
                ->exporter(ProductExporter::class),
        ]);
}
```

The ["exporter" class needs to be created](#creating-an-exporter) to tell Filament how to export each row.

## Creating an exporter

To create an exporter class for a model, you may use the `make:filament-exporter` command, passing the name of a model:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-exporter Product
```

This will create a new class in the `app/Filament/Exports` directory. You now need to define the [columns](#defining-exporter-columns) that can be exported.

### Automatically generating exporter columns

If you'd like to save time, Filament can automatically generate the [columns](#defining-exporter-columns) for you, based on your model's database columns, using `--generate`:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-exporter Product --generate
```

## Defining exporter columns

To define the columns that can be exported, you need to override the `getColumns()` method on your exporter class, returning an array of `ExportColumn` objects:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

public static function getColumns(): array
{
    return [
        ExportColumn::make('name'),
        ExportColumn::make('sku')
            ->label('SKU'),
        ExportColumn::make('price'),
    ];
}
```

### Customizing the label of an export column

The label for each column will be generated automatically from its name, but you can override it by calling the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('sku')
    ->label('SKU')
```

### Configuring the default column selection

By default, all columns will be selected when the user is asked which columns they would like to export. You can customize the default selection state for a column with the `enabledByDefault()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('description')
    ->enabledByDefault(false)
```

### Configuring the column selection form layout

By default, the column selection form uses a single column layout. You can change this using the `columnMappingColumns()` method, passing the number of columns you would like to use for the layout on large screens:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->columnMappingColumns(3)
```

This will display the column selection checkboxes and label inputs in a 3-column layout, making better use of available space when you have many exportable columns. Note that while there will be three columns in the layout on large screens, the layout will still be responsive and there will be fewer columns displayed on smaller screens.

### Disabling column selection

By default, user will be asked which columns they would like to export. You can disable this functionality using `columnMapping(false)`:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->columnMapping(false)
```

### Calculated export column state

Sometimes you need to calculate the state of a column, instead of directly reading it from a database column.

By passing a callback function to the `state()` method, you can customize the returned state for that column based on the `$record`:

```php
use App\Models\Order;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('amount_including_vat')
    ->state(function (Order $record): float {
        return $record->amount * (1 + $record->vat_rate);
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="exportColumns" version="4.x">As well as `$record`, the `state()` function can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Formatting the value of an export column

You may instead pass a custom formatting callback to `formatStateUsing()`, which accepts the `$state` of the cell, and optionally the Eloquent `$record`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('status')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => __("statuses.{$state}"))
```

<UtilityInjection set="exportColumns" version="4.x" extras="State;;mixed;;$state;;The state to format.">As well as `$state`, the `formatStateUsing()` function can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

If there are [multiple values](#exporting-multiple-values-in-a-cell) in the column, the function will be called for each value.

#### Limiting text length

You may `limit()` the length of the cell's value:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('description')
    ->limit(50)
```

<UtilityInjection set="exportColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `limit()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Limiting word count

You may limit the number of `words()` displayed in the cell:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('description')
    ->words(10)
```

<UtilityInjection set="exportColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `words()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Adding a prefix or suffix

You may add a `prefix()` or `suffix()` to the cell's value:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('domain')
    ->prefix('https://')
    ->suffix('.com')
```

<UtilityInjection set="exportColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `prefix()` and `suffix()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Exporting multiple values in a cell

By default, if there are multiple values in the column, they will be comma-separated. You may use the `listAsJson()` method to list them as a JSON array instead:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('tags')
    ->listAsJson()
```

### Displaying data from relationships

You may use "dot notation" to access columns within relationships. The name of the relationship comes first, followed by a period, followed by the name of the column to display:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('author.name')
```

### Counting relationships

If you wish to count the number of related records in a column, you may use the `counts()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('users_count')
    ->counts('users')
```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship to count from. The name of the column must be `users_count`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#counting-related-models) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

ExportColumn::make('users_count')
    ->counts([
        'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
    ])
```

### Determining relationship existence

If you simply wish to indicate whether related records exist in a column, you may use the `exists()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('users_exists')
    ->exists('users')
```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship to check for existence. The name of the column must be `users_exists`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#other-aggregate-functions) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

ExportColumn::make('users_exists')
    ->exists([
        'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
    ])
```

### Aggregating relationships

Filament provides several methods for aggregating a relationship field, including `avg()`, `max()`, `min()` and `sum()`. For instance, if you wish to show the average of a field on all related records in a column, you may use the `avg()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('users_avg_age')
    ->avg('users', 'age')
```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship, while `age` is the field that is being averaged. The name of the column must be `users_avg_age`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#other-aggregate-functions) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

ExportColumn::make('users_avg_age')
    ->avg([
        'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
    ], 'age')
```

## Configuring the export formats

By default, the export action will allow the user to choose between both CSV and XLSX formats. You can use the `ExportFormat` enum to customize this, by passing an array of formats to the `formats()` method on the action:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Enums\ExportFormat;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->formats([
        ExportFormat::Csv,
    ])
    // or
    ->formats([
        ExportFormat::Xlsx,
    ])
    // or
    ->formats([
        ExportFormat::Xlsx,
        ExportFormat::Csv,
    ])
```

Alternatively, you can override the `getFormats()` method on the exporter class, which will set the default formats for all actions that use that exporter:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Enums\ExportFormat;

public function getFormats(): array
{
    return [
        ExportFormat::Csv,
    ];
}
```

## Modifying the export query

By default, if you are using the `ExportAction` with a table, the action will use the table's currently filtered and sorted query to export the data. If you don't have a table, it will use the model's default query. To modify the query builder before exporting, you can use the `modifyQueryUsing()` method on the action:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true))
```

You may inject the `$options` argument into the function, which is an array of [options](#using-export-options) for that export:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query, array $options) => $query->where('is_active', $options['isActive'] ?? true))
```

Alternatively, you can override the `modifyQuery()` method on the exporter class, which will modify the query for all actions that use that exporter:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphTo;

public static function modifyQuery(Builder $query): Builder
{
    return $query->with([
        'purchasable' => fn (MorphTo $morphTo) => $morphTo->morphWith([
            ProductPurchase::class => ['product'],
            ServicePurchase::class => ['service'],
            Subscription::class => ['plan'],
        ]),
    ]);
}
```

## Configuring the export filesystem

### Customizing the storage disk

By default, exported files will be uploaded to the storage disk defined in the [configuration file](../../installation#publishing-configuration), which is `public` by default. You can set the `FILAMENT_FILESYSTEM_DISK` environment variable to change this.

While using the `public` disk a good default for many parts of Filament, using it for exports would result in exported files being stored in a public location. As such, if the default filesystem disk is `public` and a `local` disk exists in your `config/filesystems.php`, Filament will use the `local` disk for exports instead. If you override the disk to be `public` for an `ExportAction` or inside an exporter class, Filament will use that.

In production, you should use a disk such as `s3` with a private access policy, to prevent unauthorized access to the exported files.

If you want to use a different disk for a specific export, you can pass the disk name to the `disk()` method on the action:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->fileDisk('s3')
```

You may set the disk for all export actions at once in the `boot()` method of a service provider such as `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;

ExportAction::configureUsing(fn (ExportAction $action) => $action->fileDisk('s3'));
```

Alternatively, you can override the `getFileDisk()` method on the exporter class, returning the name of the disk:

```php
public function getFileDisk(): string
{
    return 's3';
}
```

Export files that are created are the developer's responsibility to delete if they wish. Filament does not delete these files in case the exports need to be downloaded again at a later date.

### Configuring the export file names

By default, exported files will have a name generated based on the ID and type of the export. You can also use the `fileName()` method on the action to customize the file name:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->fileName(fn (Export $export): string => "products-{$export->getKey()}.csv")
```

Alternatively, you can override the `getFileName()` method on the exporter class, returning a string:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export;

public function getFileName(Export $export): string
{
    return "products-{$export->getKey()}.csv";
}
```

## Using export options

The export action can render extra form components that the user can interact with when exporting a CSV. This can be useful to allow the user to customize the behavior of the exporter. For instance, you might want a user to be able to choose the format of specific columns when exporting. To do this, you can return options form components from the `getOptionsFormComponents()` method on your exporter class:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

public static function getOptionsFormComponents(): array
{
    return [
        TextInput::make('descriptionLimit')
            ->label('Limit the length of the description column content')
            ->integer(),
    ];
}
```

Alternatively, you can pass a set of static options to the exporter through the `options()` method on the action:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->options([
        'descriptionLimit' => 250,
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `options()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

Now, you can access the data from these options inside the exporter class, by injecting the `$options` argument into any closure function. For example, you might want to use it inside `formatStateUsing()` to [format a column's value](#formatting-the-value-of-an-export-column):

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('description')
    ->formatStateUsing(function (string $state, array $options): string {
        return (string) str($state)->limit($options['descriptionLimit'] ?? 100);
    })
```

Alternatively, since the `$options` argument is passed to all closure functions, you can access it inside `limit()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('description')
    ->limit(fn (array $options): int => $options['descriptionLimit'] ?? 100)
```

## Using a custom user model

By default, the `exports` table has a `user_id` column. That column is constrained to the `users` table:

```php
$table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained()->cascadeOnDelete();
```

In the `Export` model, the `user()` relationship is defined as a `BelongsTo` relationship to the `App\Models\User` model. If the `App\Models\User` model does not exist, or you want to use a different one, you can bind a new `Authenticatable` model to the container in a service provider's `register()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Admin;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable;

$this->app->bind(Authenticatable::class, Admin::class);
```

If your authenticatable model uses a different table to `users`, you should pass that table name to `constrained()`:

```php
$table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained('admins')->cascadeOnDelete();
```

### Using a polymorphic user relationship

If you want to associate exports with multiple user models, you can use a polymorphic `MorphTo` relationship instead. To do this, you need to replace the `user_id` column in the `exports` table:

```php
$table->morphs('user');
```

Then, in a service provider's `boot()` method, you should call `Export::polymorphicUserRelationship()` to swap the `user()` relationship on the `Export` model to a `MorphTo` relationship:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export;

Export::polymorphicUserRelationship();
```

## Limiting the maximum number of rows that can be exported

To prevent server overload, you may wish to limit the maximum number of rows that can be exported from one CSV file. You can do this by calling the `maxRows()` method on the action:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->maxRows(100000)
```

## Changing the export chunk size

Filament will chunk the CSV, and process each chunk in a different queued job. By default, chunks are 100 rows at a time. You can change this by calling the `chunkSize()` method on the action:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->chunkSize(250)
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `chunkSize()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="tip">
    If you are encountering memory or timeout issues when importing large CSV files, you may wish to reduce the chunk size.
</Aside>

## Changing the CSV delimiter

The default delimiter for CSVs is the comma (`,`). If you want to export using a different delimiter, you may override the `getCsvDelimiter()` method on the exporter class, returning a new one:

```php
public static function getCsvDelimiter(): string
{
    return ';';
}
```

<UtilityInjection set="actions" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `csvDelimiter()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

You can only specify a single character, otherwise an exception will be thrown.

## Customizing XLSX files

### Styling XLSX rows

If you want to style the cells of the XLSX file, you may override the `getXlsxCellStyle()` method on the exporter class, returning an [OpenSpout `Style` object](https://github.com/openspout/openspout/blob/4.x/docs/documentation.md#styling):

```php
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\Style;

public function getXlsxCellStyle(): ?Style
{
    return (new Style())
        ->setFontSize(12)
        ->setFontName('Consolas');
}
```

If you want to use a different style for the header cells of the XLSX file only, you may override the `getXlsxHeaderCellStyle()` method on the exporter class, returning an [OpenSpout `Style` object](https://github.com/openspout/openspout/blob/4.x/docs/documentation.md#styling):

```php
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\CellAlignment;
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\CellVerticalAlignment;
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\Color;
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\Style;

public function getXlsxHeaderCellStyle(): ?Style
{
    return (new Style())
        ->setFontBold()
        ->setFontItalic()
        ->setFontSize(14)
        ->setFontName('Consolas')
        ->setFontColor(Color::rgb(255, 255, 77))
        ->setBackgroundColor(Color::rgb(0, 0, 0))
        ->setCellAlignment(CellAlignment::CENTER)
        ->setCellVerticalAlignment(CellVerticalAlignment::CENTER);
}
```

### Styling XLSX columns

The `makeXlsxRow()` and `makeXlsxHeaderRow()` methods on the exporter class allow you to customize the styling of individual cells within a row. By default, the methods are implemented like this:

```php
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Row;
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\Style;

/**
 * @param array<mixed> $values
 */
public function makeXlsxRow(array $values, ?Style $style = null): Row
{
    return Row::fromValues($values, $style);
}
```

When a user exports, they can choose which columns to export. As such, the `$this->columnMap` property may be used to determine which columns are being exported and in which order. You can replace `Row::fromValues()` with an array of `Cell` objects, which allow you to style them individually using [OpenSpout `Style` objects](https://github.com/openspout/openspout/blob/4.x/docs/documentation.md#styling). A `StyleMerger` can be used to merge the default style with the custom style for a cell, allowing you to apply additional styles on top of the default ones:

```php
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Cell;
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Row;
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\Style;
use OpenSpout\Writer\Common\Manager\Style\StyleMerger;

/**
 * @param array<mixed> $values
 */
public function makeXlsxRow(array $values, ?Style $style = null): Row
{
    $styleMerger = new StyleMerger();

    $cells = [];
    
    foreach (array_keys($this->columnMap) as $columnIndex => $column) {
        $cells[] = match ($column) {
            'name' => Cell::fromValue(
                $values[$columnIndex],
                $styleMerger->merge(
                    (new Style())->setFontUnderline(),
                    $style,
                ),
            ),
            'price' => Cell::fromValue(
                $values[$columnIndex],
                (new Style())->setFontSize(12),
            ),
            default => Cell::fromValue($values[$columnIndex]),
        },
    }
    
    return new Row($cells, $style);
}
```

### Customizing the XLSX writer

If you want to pass "options" to the [OpenSpout XLSX `Writer`](https://github.com/openspout/openspout/blob/4.x/docs/documentation.md#column-widths), you can return an `OpenSpout\Writer\XLSX\Options` instance from the `getXlsxWriterOptions()` method of the exporter class:

```php
use OpenSpout\Writer\XLSX\Options;

public function getXlsxWriterOptions(): ?Options
{
    $options = new Options();
    $options->setColumnWidth(10, 1);
    $options->setColumnWidthForRange(12, 2, 3);
    
    return $options;
}
```

If you want to customize the XLSX writer before it is closed, you can override the `configureXlsxWriterBeforeClosing()` method on the exporter class. This method receives the `Writer` instance as a parameter, and you can modify it before it is closed:

```php
use OpenSpout\Writer\XLSX\Entity\SheetView;
use OpenSpout\Writer\XLSX\Writer;

public function configureXlsxWriterBeforeClose(Writer $writer): Writer
{
    $sheetView = new SheetView();
    $sheetView->setFreezeRow(2);
    $sheetView->setFreezeColumn('B');
    
    $sheet = $writer->getCurrentSheet();
    $sheet->setSheetView($sheetView);
    $sheet->setName('export');
    
    return $writer;
}
```

## Customizing the export job

The default job for processing exports is `Filament\Actions\Exports\Jobs\PrepareCsvExport`. If you want to extend this class and override any of its methods, you may replace the original class in the `register()` method of a service provider:

```php
use App\Jobs\PrepareCsvExport;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Jobs\PrepareCsvExport as BasePrepareCsvExport;

$this->app->bind(BasePrepareCsvExport::class, PrepareCsvExport::class);
```

Or, you can pass the new job class to the `job()` method on the action, to customize the job for a specific export:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use App\Jobs\PrepareCsvExport;
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->job(PrepareCsvExport::class)
```

### Customizing the export queue and connection

By default, the export system will use the default queue and connection. If you'd like to customize the queue used for jobs of a certain exporter, you may override the `getJobQueue()` method in your exporter class:

```php
public function getJobQueue(): ?string
{
    return 'exports';
}
```

You can also customize the connection used for jobs of a certain exporter, by overriding the `getJobConnection()` method in your exporter class:

```php
public function getJobConnection(): ?string
{
    return 'sqs';
}
```

### Customizing the export job middleware

By default, the export system will only process one job at a time from each export. This is to prevent the server from being overloaded, and other jobs from being delayed by large exports. That functionality is defined in the `WithoutOverlapping` middleware on the exporter class:

```php
public function getJobMiddleware(): array
{
    return [
        (new WithoutOverlapping("export{$this->export->getKey()}"))->expireAfter(600),
    ];
}
```

If you'd like to customize the middleware that is applied to jobs of a certain exporter, you may override this method in your exporter class. You can read more about job middleware in the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#job-middleware).

### Customizing the export job retries

By default, the export system will retry a job for 24 hours, or until it fails with 5 unhandled exceptions, whichever happens first. This is to allow for temporary issues, such as the database being unavailable, to be resolved. You may change the time period for the job to retry, which is defined in the `getJobRetryUntil()` method on the exporter class:

```php
use Carbon\CarbonInterface;

public function getJobRetryUntil(): ?CarbonInterface
{
    return now()->addHours(12);
}
```

You can read more about job retries in the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#max-job-attempts-and-timeout).

#### Customizing the export job backoff strategy

By default, the export system will wait 1 minute, then 2 minutes, then 5 minutes, then 10 minutes thereafter before retrying a job. This is to prevent the server from being overloaded by a job that is failing repeatedly. That functionality is defined in the `getJobBackoff()` method on the exporter class:

```php
/**
* @return int | array<int> | null
 */
public function getJobBackoff(): int | array | null
{
    return [60, 120, 300, 600];
}
```

You can read more about job backoff, including how to configure exponential backoffs, in the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#dealing-with-failed-jobs).

### Customizing the export job tags

By default, the export system will tag each job with the ID of the export. This is to allow you to easily find all jobs related to a certain export. That functionality is defined in the `getJobTags()` method on the exporter class:

```php
public function getJobTags(): array
{
    return ["export{$this->export->getKey()}"];
}
```

If you'd like to customize the tags that are applied to jobs of a certain exporter, you may override this method in your exporter class.

### Customizing the export job batch name

By default, the export system doesn't define any name for the job batches. If you'd like to customize the name that is applied to job batches of a certain exporter, you may override the `getJobBatchName()` method in your exporter class:

```php
public function getJobBatchName(): ?string
{
    return 'product-export';
}
```

## Authorization

By default, only the user who started the export may download files that get generated. If you'd like to customize the authorization logic, you may create an `ExportPolicy` class, and [register it in your `AuthServiceProvider`](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#registering-policies):

```php
use App\Policies\ExportPolicy;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export;

protected $policies = [
    Export::class => ExportPolicy::class,
];
```

The `view()` method of the policy will be used to authorize access to the downloads.

Please note that if you define a policy, the existing logic of ensuring only the user who started the export can access it will be removed. You will need to add that logic to your policy if you want to keep it:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export;

public function view(User $user, Export $export): bool
{
    return $export->user()->is($user);
}
```

import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/overview" alt="Account settings form example" version="4.x" />

Filament's forms package allows you to easily build dynamic forms in your app. It's used within other Filament packages to render forms within [panel resources](../panels/resources), [action modals](../actions/modals), [table filters](../tables/filters), and more. Learning how to build forms is essential to learning how to use these Filament packages.

This guide will walk you through the basics of building forms with Filament's form package. If you're planning to add a new form to your own Livewire component, you should [do that first](../components/form) and then come back. If you're adding a form to a [panel resource](../panels/resources), or another Filament package, you're ready to go!

## Form fields

Form field classes can be found in the `Filament\Form\Components` namespace. They reside within the schema array of components. Filament ships with many types of field, suitable for editing different types of data:

- [Text input](text-input)
- [Select](select)
- [Checkbox](checkbox)
- [Toggle](toggle)
- [Checkbox list](checkbox-list)
- [Radio](radio)
- [Date-time picker](date-time-picker)
- [File upload](file-upload)
- [Rich editor](rich-editor)
- [Markdown editor](markdown-editor)
- [Repeater](repeater)
- [Builder](builder)
- [Tags input](tags-input)
- [Textarea](textarea)
- [Key-value](key-value)
- [Color picker](color-picker)
- [Toggle buttons](toggle-buttons)
- [Slider](slider)
- [Code editor](code-editor)
- [Hidden](hidden)

You may also [create your own custom fields](custom-fields) to edit data however you wish.

Fields may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its unique name. Usually, the name of a field corresponds to the name of an attribute on an Eloquent model:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/simple" alt="Form field" version="4.x" />

You may use "dot notation" to bind fields to keys in arrays:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('socials.github_url')
```

## Validating fields

In Laravel, validation rules are usually defined in arrays like `['required', 'max:255']` or a combined string like `required|max:255`. This is fine if you're exclusively working in the backend with simple form requests. But Filament is also able to give your users frontend validation, so they can fix their mistakes before any backend requests are made.

In Filament, you can add validation rules to your fields by using methods like `required()` and `maxLength()`. This is also advantageous over Laravel's validation syntax, since your IDE can autocomplete these methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->required()
    ->maxLength(255)
```

In this example, the fields is `required()`, and has a `maxLength()`. We have [methods for most of Laravel's validation rules](validation#available-rules), and you can even add your own [custom rules](validation#custom-rules).

## Setting a field's label

By default, the label of the field will be automatically determined based on its name. To override the field's label, you may use the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->label('Full name')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `label()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

Customizing the label in this way is useful if you wish to use a [translation string for localization](https://laravel.com/docs/localization#retrieving-translation-strings):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->label(__('fields.name'))
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    You can also [use a JavaScript expression](#using-javascript-to-determine-text-content) to determine the content of the label, which can read the current values of fields in the form.
</Aside>

### Hiding a field's label

It may be tempting to set the label to an empty string to hide it, but this is not recommended. Setting the label to an empty string will not communicate the purpose of the field to screen readers, even if the purpose is clear visually. Instead, you should use the `hiddenLabel()` method, so it is hidden visually but still accessible to screen readers:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->hiddenLabel()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the label should be hidden or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->hiddenLabel(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `hiddenLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Setting the default value of a field

Fields may have a default value. The default is only used when a schema is loaded with no data. In a standard [panel resource](../resources), defaults are used on the Create page, not the Edit page. To define a default value, use the `default()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->default('John')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `default()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Disabling a field

You may disable a field to prevent it from being edited by the user:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->disabled()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/disabled" alt="Disabled form field" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the field should be disabled or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->disabled(! FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `disabled()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

Disabling a field will prevent it from being saved. If you'd like it to be saved, but still not editable, use the `dehydrated()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->disabled()
    ->dehydrated()
```

<Aside variant="danger">
    If you choose to dehydrate the field, a skilled user could still edit the field's value by manipulating Livewire's JavaScript.
</Aside>

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the field should be dehydrated or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->disabled()
    ->dehydrated(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `dehydrated()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Disabling a field based on the current operation

The "operation" of a schema is the current action being performed on it. Usually, this is either `create`, `edit` or `view`, if you are using the [panel resource](../resources).

You can disable a field based on the current operation by passing an operation to the `disabledOn()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->disabledOn('edit')

// is the same as

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->disabled(fn (string $operation): bool => $operation === 'edit')
```

You can also pass an array of operations to the `disabledOn()` method, and the field will be disabled if the current operation is any of the operations in the array:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->disabledOn(['edit', 'view'])
    
// is the same as

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->disabled(fn (string $operation): bool => in_array($operation, ['edit', 'view']))
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    The `disabledOn()` method will overwrite any previous calls to the `disabled()` method, and vice versa.
</Aside>

## Hiding a field

You may hide a field:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->hidden()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the field should be hidden or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->hidden(! FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `hidden()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

Alternatively, you may use the `visible()` method to control if the field should be hidden or not. In some situations, this may help to make your code more readable:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->visible(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `visible()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="info">
    If both `hidden()` and `visible()` are used, they both need to indicate that the field should be visible for it to be shown.
</Aside>

### Hiding a field using JavaScript

If you need to hide a field based on a user interaction, you can use the `hidden()` or `visible()` methods, passing a function that uses utilities injected to determine whether the field should be hidden or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Select::make('role')
    ->options([
        'user' => 'User',
        'staff' => 'Staff',
    ])
    ->live()

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->hidden(fn (Get $get): bool => $get('role') !== 'staff')
```

In this example, the `role` field is set to `live()`, which means that the schema will reload the schema each time the `role` field is changed. This will cause the function that is passed to the `hidden()` method to be re-evaluated, which will hide the `is_admin` field if the `role` field is not set to `staff`.

However, reloading the schema each time a field causes a network request to be made, since there is no way to re-run the PHP function from the client-side. This is not ideal for performance.

Alternatively, you can write JavaScript to hide the field based on the value of another field. This is done by passing a JavaScript expression to the `hiddenJs()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Select::make('role')
    ->options([
        'user' => 'User',
        'staff' => 'Staff',
    ])

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->hiddenJs(<<<'JS'
        $get('role') !== 'staff'
        JS)
```

Although the code passed to `hiddenJs()` looks very similar to PHP, it is actually JavaScript. Filament provides the `$get()` utility function to JavaScript that behaves very similar to its PHP equivalent, but without requiring the depended-on field to be `live()`.

<Aside variant="danger">
    Any JS string passed to the `hiddenJs()` method will be executed in the browser, so you should never add user input directly into the string, as it could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. User input from `$state` or `$get()` should never be evaluated as JavaScript code, but is safe to use as a string value, like in the example above.
</Aside>

The `visibleJs()` method is also available, which works in the same way as `hiddenJs()`, but controls if the field should be visible or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Select::make('role')
    ->options([
        'user' => 'User',
        'staff' => 'Staff',
    ])

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->visibleJs(<<<'JS'
        $get('role') === 'staff'
        JS)
```

<Aside variant="danger">
    Any JS string passed to the `visibleJs()` method will be executed in the browser, so you should never add user input directly into the string, as it could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

### Hiding a field based on the current operation

The "operation" of a schema is the current action being performed on it. Usually, this is either `create`, `edit` or `view`, if you are using the [panel resource](../resources).

You can hide a field based on the current operation by passing an operation to the `hiddenOn()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->hiddenOn('edit')
    
// is the same as

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->hidden(fn (string $operation): bool => $operation === 'edit')
```

You can also pass an array of operations to the `hiddenOn()` method, and the field will be hidden if the current operation is any of the operations in the array:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->hiddenOn(['edit', 'view'])
    
// is the same as

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->hidden(fn (string $operation): bool => in_array($operation, ['edit', 'view']))
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    The `hiddenOn()` method will overwrite any previous calls to the `hidden()` method, and vice versa.
</Aside>

Alternatively, you may use the `visibleOn()` method to control if the field should be hidden or not. In some situations, this may help to make your code more readable:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->visibleOn('create')

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->visibleOn(['create', 'edit'])
```

<Aside variant="info">
    The `visibleOn()` method will overwrite any previous calls to the `visible()` method, and vice versa.
</Aside>

## Inline labels

Fields may have their labels displayed inline with the field, rather than above it. This is useful for forms with many fields, where vertical space is at a premium. To display a field's label inline, use the `inlineLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->inlineLabel()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/inline-label" alt="Form field with inline label" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the label should be displayed inline or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->inlineLabel(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `inlineLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Using inline labels in multiple places at once

If you wish to display all labels inline in a [layout component](../schemas/layouts) like a [section](../schemas/sections) or [tab](../schemas/tabs), you can use the `inlineLabel()` on the component itself, and all fields within it will have their labels displayed inline:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Details')
    ->inlineLabel()
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name'),
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->label('Email address'),
        TextInput::make('phone')
            ->label('Phone number'),
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/inline-label/section" alt="Form fields with inline labels in a section" version="4.x" />

You can also use `inlineLabel()` on the entire schema to display all labels inline:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function form(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->inlineLabel()
        ->components([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

When using `inlineLabel()` on a layout component or schema, you can still opt-out of inline labels for individual fields by using the `inlineLabel(false)` method on the field:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Details')
    ->inlineLabel()
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name'),
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->label('Email address'),
        TextInput::make('phone')
            ->label('Phone number')
            ->inlineLabel(false),
    ])
```

## Autofocusing a field when the schema is loaded

Most fields are autofocusable. Typically, you should aim for the first significant field in your schema to be autofocused for the best user experience. You can nominate a field to be autofocused using the `autofocus()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->autofocus()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the field should be autofocused or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->autofocus(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `autofocus()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Setting the placeholder of a field

Many fields can display a placeholder for when they have no value. This is displayed in the UI but never saved when the form is submitted. You may customize this placeholder using the `placeholder()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->placeholder('John Doe')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `placeholder()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/placeholder" alt="Form field with placeholder" version="4.x" />

## Fusing fields together into a group

A `FusedGroup` component can be used to "fuse" multiple fields together. The following fields can be fused together the best:

- [Text input](text-input)
- [Select](select)
- [Date-time picker](date-time-picker)
- [Color picker](color-picker)

The fields that should be fused are passed to the `make()` method of the `FusedGroup` component:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\FusedGroup;

FusedGroup::make([
    TextInput::make('city')
        ->placeholder('City'),
    Select::make('country')
        ->placeholder('Country')
        ->options([
            // ...
        ]),
])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/fused" alt="Fused group of form fields" version="4.x" />

You can add a label above the group of fields using the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\FusedGroup;

FusedGroup::make([
    // ...
])
    ->label('Location')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/fused-label" alt="Fused group of form fields with label" version="4.x" />

By default, each field will have its own row. On mobile devices, this is often the most optimal experience, but on desktop you can use the `columns()` method, the same as for [layout components](../schemas/layouts#grid-system) to display the fields horizontally:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\FusedGroup;

FusedGroup::make([
    // ...
])
    ->label('Location')
    ->columns(2)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/fused-columns" alt="Fused group of form fields in columns" version="4.x" />

You can adjust the width of the fields in the grid by passing `columnSpan()` to each field:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\FusedGroup;

FusedGroup::make([
    TextInput::make('city')
        ->placeholder('City')
        ->columnSpan(2),
    Select::make('country')
        ->placeholder('Country')
        ->options([
            // ...
        ]),
])
    ->label('Location')
    ->columns(3)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/fused-columns-span" alt="Fused group of form fields in columns with customized span" version="4.x" />

## Adding extra content to a field

Fields contain many "slots" where content can be inserted in a child schema. Slots can accept text, [any schema component](../schemas), [actions](../actions) and [action groups](../actions/grouping-actions). Usually, [prime components](../schemas/primes) are used for content.

The following slots are available for all fields:

- `aboveLabel()`
- `beforeLabel()`
- `afterLabel()`
- `belowLabel()`
- `aboveContent()`
- `beforeContent()`
- `afterContent()`
- `belowContent()`
- `aboveErrorMessage()`
- `belowErrorMessage()`

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the slot methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

To insert plain text, you can pass a string to these methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->belowContent('This is the user\'s full name.')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/below-content/text" alt="Form field with text below content" version="4.x" />

To insert a schema component, often a [prime component](../schemas/primes), you can pass the component to the method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->belowContent(Text::make('This is the user\'s full name.')->weight(FontWeight::Bold))
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/below-content/component" alt="Form field with component below content" version="4.x" />

To insert an [action](../actions) or [action group](../actions/grouping-actions), you can pass the action or action group to the method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->belowContent(Action::make('generate'))
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/below-content/action" alt="Form field with action below content" version="4.x" />

You can insert any combination of content into the slots by passing an array of content to the method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->belowContent([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::InformationCircle),
        'This is the user\'s full name.',
        Action::make('generate'),
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/below-content" alt="Form field with multiple components below content" version="4.x" />

You can also align the content in the slots by passing the array of content to either `Schema::start()` (default), `Schema::end()` or `Schema::between()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Flex;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->belowContent(Schema::end([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::InformationCircle),
        'This is the user\'s full name.',
        Action::make('generate'),
    ]))

TextInput::make('name')
    ->belowContent(Schema::between([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::InformationCircle),
        'This is the user\'s full name.',
        Action::make('generate'),
    ]))

TextInput::make('name')
    ->belowContent(Schema::between([
        Flex::make([
            Icon::make(Heroicon::InformationCircle)
                ->grow(false),
            'This is the user\'s full name.',
        ]),
        Action::make('generate'),
    ]))
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    As you can see in the above example for `Schema::between()`, a [`Flex` component](../schemas/layouts#flex-component) is used to group the icon and text together so they do not have space between them. The icon uses `grow(false)` to prevent it from taking up half of the horizontal space, allowing the text to consume the remaining space.
</Aside>

### Adding extra content above a field's label

You can insert extra content above a field's label using the `aboveLabel()` method. You can [pass any content](#adding-extra-content-to-a-field) to this method, like text, a schema component, an action, or an action group:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->aboveLabel([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::Star),
        'This is the content above the field\'s label'
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `aboveLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/above-label" alt="Form field with extra content above label" version="4.x" />

### Adding extra content before a field's label

You can insert extra content before a field's label using the `beforeLabel()` method. You can [pass any content](#adding-extra-content-to-a-field) to this method, like text, a schema component, an action, or an action group:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->beforeLabel(Icon::make(Heroicon::Star))
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `beforeLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/before-label" alt="Form field with extra content before label" version="4.x" />

### Adding extra content after a field's label

You can insert extra content after a field's label using the `afterLabel()` method. You can [pass any content](#adding-extra-content-to-a-field) to this method, like text, a schema component, an action, or an action group:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->afterLabel([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::Star),
        'This is the content after the field\'s label'
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `afterLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/after-label" alt="Form field with extra content after label" version="4.x" />

By default, the content in the `afterLabel()` schema is aligned to the end of the container. If you wish to align it to the start of the container, you should pass a `Schema::start()` object containing the content:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->afterLabel(Schema::start([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::Star),
        'This is the content after the field\'s label'
    ]))
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `afterLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/after-label/aligned-start" alt="Form field with extra content after label aligned to the start" version="4.x" />

### Adding extra content below a field's label

You can insert extra content below a field's label using the `belowLabel()` method. You can [pass any content](#adding-extra-content-to-a-field) to this method, like text, a schema component, an action, or an action group:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->belowLabel([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::Star),
        'This is the content below the field\'s label'
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `belowLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/below-label" alt="Form field with extra content below label" version="4.x" />

<Aside variant="info">
    This may seem like the same as the [`aboveContent()` method](#adding-extra-content-above-a-fields-content). However, when using [inline labels](#inline-labels), the `aboveContent()` method will place the content above the field, not below the label, since the label is displayed in a separate column to the field content.
</Aside>

### Adding extra content above a field's content

You can insert extra content above a field's content using the `aboveContent()` method. You can [pass any content](#adding-extra-content-to-a-field) to this method, like text, a schema component, an action, or an action group:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->aboveContent([

    Some fields, such as the [text input](text-input#adding-affix-text-aside-the-field), [select](select#adding-affix-text-aside-the-field), and [date-time picker](date-time-picker#adding-affix-text-aside-the-field) fields, have a `prefix()` method to insert content before the field's content, adjoined to the field itself. This is often a better UI choice than using `beforeContent()`.

use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->afterContent(Icon::make(Heroicon::Star))
```

    Some fields, such as the [text input](text-input#adding-affix-text-aside-the-field), [select](select#adding-affix-text-aside-the-field), and [date-time picker](date-time-picker#adding-affix-text-aside-the-field) fields, have a `suffix()` method to insert content after the field's content, adjoined to the field itself. This is often a better UI choice than using `beforeContent()`.

### Adding extra content above a field's error message

You can insert extra content above a field's [error message](validation) using the `aboveErrorMessage()` method. It will not be visible unless an error message is displayed. You can [pass any content](#adding-extra-content-to-a-field) to this method, like text, a schema component, an action, or an action group:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->required()
    ->aboveErrorMessage([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::Star),
        'This is the content above the field\'s error message'
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `aboveErrorMessage()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/above-error-message" alt="Form field with extra content above error message" version="4.x" />

### Adding extra content below a field's error message

You can insert extra content below a field's [error message](validation) using the `belowErrorMessage()` method. It will not be visible unless an error message is displayed. You can [pass any content](#adding-extra-content-to-a-field) to this method, like text, a schema component, an action, or an action group:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->required()
    ->belowErrorMessage([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::Star),
        'This is the content below the field\'s error message'
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `belowErrorMessage()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/below-error-message" alt="Form field with extra content below error message" version="4.x" />

## Adding extra HTML attributes to a field

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the field via the `extraAttributes()` method, which will be merged onto its outer HTML element. The attributes should be represented by an array, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->extraAttributes(['title' => 'Text input'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `extraAttributes()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="tip">
    By default, calling `extraAttributes()` multiple times will overwrite the previous attributes. If you wish to merge the attributes instead, you can pass `merge: true` to the method.
</Aside>

### Adding extra HTML attributes to the input element of a field

Some fields use an underlying `<input>` or `<select>` DOM element, but this is often not the outer element in the field, so the `extraAttributes()` method may not work as you wish. In this case, you may use the `extraInputAttributes()` method, which will merge the attributes onto the `<input>` or `<select>` element in the field's HTML:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('categories')
    ->extraInputAttributes(['width' => 200])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `extraInputAttributes()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="tip">
    By default, calling `extraInputAttributes()` multiple times will overwrite the previous attributes. If you wish to merge the attributes instead, you can pass `merge: true` to the method.
</Aside>

### Adding extra HTML attributes to the field wrapper

You can also pass extra HTML attributes to the very outer element of the "field wrapper" which surrounds the label and content of the field. This is useful if you want to style the label or spacing of the field via CSS, since you could target elements as children of the wrapper:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('categories')
    ->extraFieldWrapperAttributes(['class' => 'components-locked'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `extraFieldWrapperAttributes()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="tip">
    By default, calling `extraFieldWrapperAttributes()` multiple times will overwrite the previous attributes. If you wish to merge the attributes instead, you can pass `merge: true` to the method.
</Aside>

## Field utility injection

The vast majority of methods used to configure fields accept functions as parameters instead of hardcoded values:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->displayFormat(function (): string {
        if (auth()->user()->country_id === 'us') {
            return 'm/d/Y';
        }

        return 'd/m/Y';
    })

Select::make('user_id')
    ->options(function (): array {
        return User::query()->pluck('name', 'id')->all();
    })

TextInput::make('middle_name')
    ->required(fn (): bool => auth()->user()->hasMiddleName())
```

This alone unlocks many customization possibilities.

The package is also able to inject many utilities to use inside these functions, as parameters. All customization methods that accept functions as arguments can inject utilities.

These injected utilities require specific parameter names to be used. Otherwise, Filament doesn't know what to inject.

### Injecting the current state of the field

If you wish to access the current value (state) of the field, define a `$state` parameter:

```php
function ($state) {
    // ...
}
```

#### Injecting the raw state of the field

If a field casts its state automatically to a more useful format, you may wish to access the raw state. To do this, define a `$rawState` parameter:

```php
function ($rawState) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the state of another field

You may also retrieve the state (value) of another field from within a callback, using a `$get` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

function (Get $get) {
    $email = $get('email'); // Store the value of the `email` field in the `$email` variable.
    //...
}
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    Unless a form field is [reactive](#the-basics-of-reactivity), the schema will not refresh when the value of the field changes, only when the next user interaction occurs that makes a request to the server. If you need to react to changes in a field's value, it should be `live()`.
</Aside>

### Injecting the current Eloquent record

You may retrieve the Eloquent record for the current schema using a `$record` parameter:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

function (?Model $record) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current operation

If you're writing a schema for a panel resource or relation manager, and you wish to check if a schema is `create`, `edit` or `view`, use the `$operation` parameter:

```php
function (string $operation) {
    // ...
}
```

<Aside variant="info">
    You can manually set a schema's operation using the `$schema->operation()` method.
</Aside>

### Injecting the current Livewire component instance

If you wish to access the current Livewire component instance, define a `$livewire` parameter:

```php
use Livewire\Component;

function (Component $livewire) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current field instance

If you wish to access the current component instance, define a `$component` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Field;

function (Field $component) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting multiple utilities

The parameters are injected dynamically using reflection, so you are able to combine multiple parameters in any order:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;
use Livewire\Component as Livewire;

function (Livewire $livewire, Get $get, Set $set) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting dependencies from Laravel's container

You may inject anything from Laravel's container like normal, alongside utilities:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

function (Request $request, Set $set) {
    // ...
}
```

### Using JavaScript to determine text content

Methods that allow HTML to be rendered, such as [`label()`](#setting-a-fields-label) and [`Text::make()` passed to a `belowContent()` method](#adding-extra-content-to-a-field) can use JavaScript to calculate their content instead. This is achieved by passing a `JsContent` object to the method, which is `Htmlable`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\JsContent;

TextInput::make('greetingResponse')
    ->label(JsContent::make(<<<'JS'
        ($get('name') === 'John Doe') ? 'Hello, John!' : 'Hello, stranger!'
        JS
    ))
```

The [`$state`](#injecting-the-current-state-of-the-field) and [`$get`](#injecting-the-state-of-another-field) utilities are available in this JavaScript context, so you can use them to access the state of the field and other fields in the schema.

## The basics of reactivity

[Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) is a tool that allows Blade-rendered HTML to dynamically re-render without requiring a full page reload. Filament schemas are built on top of Livewire, so they are able to re-render dynamically, allowing their content to adapt after they are initially rendered.

By default, when a user uses a field, the schema will not re-render. Since rendering requires a round-trip to the server, this is a performance optimization. However, if you wish to re-render the schema after the user has interacted with a field, you can use the `live()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->live()
```

In this example, when the user changes the value of the `status` field, the schema will re-render. This allows you to then make changes to fields in the schema based on the new value of the `status` field. Also, you can [hook in to the field's lifecycle](#field-updates) to perform custom logic when the field is updated.

### Reactive fields on blur

By default, when a field is set to `live()`, the schema will re-render every time the field is interacted with. However, this may not be appropriate for some fields like the text input, since making network requests while the user is still typing results in suboptimal performance. You may wish to re-render the schema only after the user has finished using the field, when it becomes out of focus. You can do this using the `live(onBlur: true)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('username')
    ->live(onBlur: true)
```

### Debouncing reactive fields

You may wish to find a middle ground between `live()` and `live(onBlur: true)`, using "debouncing". Debouncing will prevent a network request from being sent until a user has finished typing for a certain period of time. You can do this using the `live(debounce: 500)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('username')
    ->live(debounce: 500) // Wait 500ms before re-rendering the schema.
```

In this example, `500` is the number of milliseconds to wait before sending a network request. You can customize this number to whatever you want, or even use a string like `'1s'`.

## Field lifecycle

Each field in a schema has a lifecycle, which is the process it goes through when the schema is loaded, when it is interacted with by the user, and when it is submitted. You may customize what happens at each stage of this lifecycle using a function that gets run at that stage.

### Field hydration

Hydration is the process that fills fields with data. It runs when you call the schema's `fill()` method. You may customize what happens after a field is hydrated using the `afterStateHydrated()` method.

In this example, the `name` field will always be hydrated with the correctly capitalized name:

```php
use Closure;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->required()
    ->afterStateHydrated(function (TextInput $component, string $state) {
        $component->state(ucwords($state));
    })
```

As a shortcut for formatting the field's state like this when it is hydrated, you can use the `formatStateUsing()` method:

```php
use Closure;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => ucwords($state))
```

### Field updates

You may use the `afterStateUpdated()` method to customize what happens after the user updates a field:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->afterStateUpdated(function (?string $state, ?string $old) {
        // ...
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Old state;;mixed;;$old;;The old value of the field, before it was updated.||Old raw state;;mixed;;$oldRaw;;The old value of the field, before state casts were applied.||Set function;;Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;;$set;;A function to set values in the current form data.">The `afterStateUpdated()` method injects various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="tip">
    When using `afterStateUpdated()` on a reactive field, interactions will not feel instant since a network request is made. There are a few ways you can [optimize and avoid rendering](#field-rendering) which will make the interaction feel faster.
</Aside>

#### Setting the state of another field

In a similar way to `$get`, you may also set the value of another field from within `afterStateUpdated()`, using a `$set` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;

function (Set $set) {
    $set('title', 'Blog Post'); // Set the `title` field to `Blog Post`.
    //...
}
```

When this function is run, the state of the `title` field will be updated, and the schema will re-render with the new title.

By default, the `afterStateUpdated()` method of the field you set is not called when you use `$set()`. If you wish to call it, you can pass `shouldCallUpdatedHooks: true` as an argument:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;

function (Set $set) {
    $set('title', 'Blog Post', shouldCallUpdatedHooks: true);
    //...
}
```

### Field dehydration

Dehydration is the process that gets data from the fields in your schemas, optionally transforms it, and returns it. It runs when you call the schema's `getState()` method, which is usually called when a form is submitted.

You may customize how the state is transformed when it is dehydrated using the `dehydrateStateUsing()` function. In this example, the `name` field will always be dehydrated with the correctly capitalized name:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->required()
    ->dehydrateStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => ucwords($state))
```

#### Preventing a field from being dehydrated

You may also prevent a field from being dehydrated altogether using `dehydrated(false)`. In this example, the field will not be present in the array returned from `getState()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('password_confirmation')
    ->password()
    ->dehydrated(false)
```

If your schema auto-saves data to the database, like in a [resource](../resources), this is useful to prevent a field from being saved to the database if it is purely used for presentational purposes.

<Aside variant="info">
    Even when a field is not dehydrated, it is still validated. To learn more about this behavior, see the [validation](validation#disabling-validation-when-fields-are-not-dehydrated) section.
</Aside>

### Field rendering

Each time a reactive field is updated, the HTML entire Livewire component that the schema belongs to is re-generated and sent to the frontend via a network request. In some cases, this may be overkill, especially if the schema is large and only certain components have changed.

#### Field partial rendering

In this example, the value of the "name" input is used in the label of the "email" input. The "name" input is [`live()`](#the-basics-of-reactivity), so when the user types in the "name" input, the entire schema is re-rendered. This is not ideal, since only the "email" input needs to be re-rendered:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->live()
    
TextInput::make('email')
    ->label(fn (Get $get): string => filled($get('name')) ? "Email address for {$get('name')}" : 'Email address')
```

In this case, a simple call to `partiallyRenderComponentsAfterStateUpdated()`, passing the names of other fields to re-render, will make the schema re-render only the specified fields [after the state is updated](#field-updates):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->live()
    ->partiallyRenderComponentsAfterStateUpdated(['email'])
```

Alternatively, you can instruct Filament to re-render the current component only, using `partiallyRenderAfterStateUpdated()`. This is useful if the reactive component is the only one that depends on its current state:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->live()
    ->partiallyRenderAfterStateUpdated()
    ->belowContent(fn (Get $get): ?string => filled($get('name')) ? "Hi, {$get('name')}!" : null)
```

#### Preventing the Livewire component from rendering after a field is updated

If you wish to prevent the Livewire component from re-rendering when a field is [updated](#field-updates), you can use the `skipRenderAfterStateUpdated()` method. This is useful if you want to perform some action when the field is updated, but you don't want the Livewire component to re-render:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->live()
    ->skipRenderAfterStateUpdated()
    ->afterStateUpdated(function (string $state) {
        // Do something with the state, but don't re-render the Livewire component.
    })
```

Since [setting the state of another field](#setting-the-state-of-another-field) from an `afterStateUpdated()` function using the `$set()` method will actually just mutate the frontend state of fields, you don't even need a network request in the first place. The `afterStateUpdatedJs()` method accepts a JavaScript expression that runs each time the value of the field changes. The [`$state`](#injecting-the-current-state-of-the-field), [`$get()`](#injecting-the-state-of-another-field) and [`$set()`](#setting-the-state-of-another-field) utilities are available in the JavaScript context, so you can use them to set the state of other fields:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;

// Old name input that is `live()`, so it makes a network request and render each time it is updated.
TextInput::make('name')
    ->live()
    ->afterStateUpdated(fn (Set $set, ?string $state) => $set('email', ((string) str($state)->replace(' ', '.')->lower()) . '@example.com'))

// New name input that uses `afterStateUpdatedJs()` to set the state of the email field and doesn't make a network request.
TextInput::make('name')
    ->afterStateUpdatedJs(<<<'JS'
        $set('email', ($state ?? '').replaceAll(' ', '.').toLowerCase() + '@example.com')
        JS)
    
TextInput::make('email')
    ->label('Email address')
```

<Aside variant="danger">
    Any JS string passed to the `afterStateUpdatedJs()` method will be executed in the browser, so you should never add user input directly into the string, as it could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. User input from `$state` or `$get()` should never be evaluated as JavaScript code, but is safe to use as a string value, like in the example above.
</Aside>

## Reactive forms cookbook

This section contains a collection of recipes for common tasks you may need to perform when building an advanced form.

### Conditionally hiding a field

To conditionally hide or show a field, you can pass a function to the `hidden()` method, and return `true` or `false` depending on whether you want the field to be hidden or not. The function can [inject utilities](#field-utility-injection) as parameters, so you can do things like check the value of another field:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Checkbox::make('is_company')
    ->live()

TextInput::make('company_name')
    ->hidden(fn (Get $get): bool => ! $get('is_company'))
```

In this example, the `is_company` checkbox is [`live()`](#the-basics-of-reactivity). This allows the schema to rerender when the value of the `is_company` field changes. You can access the value of that field from within the `hidden()` function using the [`$get()` utility](#injecting-the-state-of-another-field). The value of the field is inverted using `!` so that the `company_name` field is hidden when the `is_company` field is `false`.

Alternatively, you can use the `visible()` method to show a field conditionally. It does the exact inverse of `hidden()`, and could be used if you prefer the clarity of the code when written this way:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Checkbox::make('is_company')
    ->live()
    
TextInput::make('company_name')
    ->visible(fn (Get $get): bool => $get('is_company'))
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    Using `live()` means the schema reloads every time the field changes, triggering a network request.
    Alternatively, you can use [JavaScript to hide the field based on another field's value](#hiding-a-field-using-javascript).
</Aside>

### Conditionally making a field required

To conditionally make a field required, you can pass a function to the `required()` method, and return `true` or `false` depending on whether you want the field to be required or not. The function can [inject utilities](#field-utility-injection) as parameters, so you can do things like check the value of another field:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('company_name')
    ->live(onBlur: true)
    
TextInput::make('vat_number')
    ->required(fn (Get $get): bool => filled($get('company_name')))
```

In this example, the `company_name` field is [`live(onBlur: true)`](#reactive-fields-on-blur). This allows the schema to rerender after the value of the `company_name` field changes and the user clicks away. You can access the value of that field from within the `required()` function using the [`$get()` utility](#injecting-the-state-of-another-field). The value of the field is checked using `filled()` so that the `vat_number` field is required when the `company_name` field is not `null` or an empty string. The result is that the `vat_number` field is only required when the `company_name` field is filled in.

Using a function is able to make any other [validation rule](validation) dynamic in a similar way.

### Generating a slug from a title

To generate a slug from a title while the user is typing, you can use the [`afterStateUpdated()` method](#field-updates) on the title field to [`$set()`](#setting-the-state-of-another-field) the value of the slug field:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

TextInput::make('title')
    ->live(onBlur: true)
    ->afterStateUpdated(fn (Set $set, ?string $state) => $set('slug', Str::slug($state)))
    
TextInput::make('slug')
```

In this example, the `title` field is [`live(onBlur: true)`](#reactive-fields-on-blur). This allows the schema to rerender when the value of the `title` field changes and the user clicks away. The `afterStateUpdated()` method is used to run a function after the state of the `title` field is updated. The function injects the [`$set()` utility](#setting-the-state-of-another-field) and the new state of the `title` field. The `Str::slug()` utility method is part of Laravel and is used to generate a slug from a string. The `slug` field is then updated using the `$set()` function.

One thing to note is that the user may customize the slug manually, and we don't want to overwrite their changes if the title changes. To prevent this, we can use the old version of the title to work out if the user has modified it themselves. To access the old version of the title, you can inject `$old`, and to get the current value of the slug before it gets changed, we can use the [`$get()` utility](#injecting-the-state-of-another-field):

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

TextInput::make('title')
    ->live(onBlur: true)
    ->afterStateUpdated(function (Get $get, Set $set, ?string $old, ?string $state) {
        if (($get('slug') ?? '') !== Str::slug($old)) {
            return;
        }
    
        $set('slug', Str::slug($state));
    })
    
TextInput::make('slug')
```

### Dependant select options

To dynamically update the options of a [select field](select) based on the value of another field, you can pass a function to the `options()` method of the select field. The function can [inject utilities](#field-utility-injection) as parameters, so you can do things like check the value of another field using the [`$get()` utility](#injecting-the-state-of-another-field):

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('category')
    ->options([
        'web' => 'Web development',
        'mobile' => 'Mobile development',
        'design' => 'Design',
    ])
    ->live()

Select::make('sub_category')
    ->options(fn (Get $get): array => match ($get('category')) {
        'web' => [
            'frontend_web' => 'Frontend development',
            'backend_web' => 'Backend development',
        ],
        'mobile' => [
            'ios_mobile' => 'iOS development',
            'android_mobile' => 'Android development',
        ],
        'design' => [
            'app_design' => 'Panel design',
            'marketing_website_design' => 'Marketing website design',
        ],
        default => [],
    })
```

In this example, the `category` field is [`live()`](#the-basics-of-reactivity). This allows the schema to rerender when the value of the `category` field changes. You can access the value of that field from within the `options()` function using the [`$get()` utility](#injecting-the-state-of-another-field). The value of the field is used to determine which options should be available in the `sub_category` field. The `match ()` statement in PHP is used to return an array of options based on the value of the `category` field. The result is that the `sub_category` field will only show options relevant to the selected `category` field.

You could adapt this example to use options loaded from an Eloquent model or other data source, by querying within the function:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

Select::make('category')
    ->options(Category::query()->pluck('name', 'id'))
    ->live()
    
Select::make('sub_category')
    ->options(fn (Get $get): Collection => SubCategory::query()
        ->where('category', $get('category'))
        ->pluck('name', 'id'))
```

### Dynamic fields based on a select option

You may wish to render a different set of fields based on the value of a field, like a select. To do this, you can pass a function to the `schema()` method of any [layout component](../schemas/layouts), which checks the value of the field and returns a different schema based on that value. Also, you will need a way to initialise the new fields in the dynamic schema when they are first loaded.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

Select::make('type')
    ->options([
        'employee' => 'Employee',
        'freelancer' => 'Freelancer',
    ])
    ->live()
    ->afterStateUpdated(fn (Select $component) => $component
        ->getContainer()
        ->getComponent('dynamicTypeFields')
        ->getChildSchema()
        ->fill())
    
Grid::make(2)
    ->schema(fn (Get $get): array => match ($get('type')) {
        'employee' => [
            TextInput::make('employee_number')
                ->required(),
            FileUpload::make('badge')
                ->image()
                ->required(),
        ],
        'freelancer' => [
            TextInput::make('hourly_rate')
                ->numeric()
                ->required()
                ->prefix('€'),
            FileUpload::make('contract')
                ->required(),
        ],
        default => [],
    })
    ->key('dynamicTypeFields')
```

In this example, the `type` field is [`live()`](#the-basics-of-reactivity). This allows the schema to rerender when the value of the `type` field changes. The `afterStateUpdated()` method is used to run a function after the state of the `type` field is updated. In this case, we [inject the current select field instance](#injecting-the-current-field-instance), which we can then use to get the schema "container" instance that holds both the select and the grid components. With this container, we can target the grid component using a unique key (`dynamicTypeFields`) that we have assigned to it. With that grid component instance, we can call `fill()`, just as we do on a normal form to initialise it. The `schema()` method of the grid component is then used to return a different schema based on the value of the `type` field. This is done by using the [`$get()` utility](#injecting-the-state-of-another-field), and returning a different schema array dynamically.

### Auto-hashing password field

You have a password field:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
```

And you can use a [dehydration function](#field-dehydration) to hash the password when the form is submitted:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->dehydrateStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => Hash::make($state))
```

But if your schema is used to change an existing password, you don't want to overwrite the existing password if the field is empty. You can [prevent the field from being dehydrated](#preventing-a-field-from-being-dehydrated) if the field is null or an empty string (using the `filled()` helper):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->dehydrateStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => Hash::make($state))
    ->dehydrated(fn (?string $state): bool => filled($state))
```

However, you want to require the password to be filled when the user is being created, by [injecting the `$operation` utility](#injecting-the-current-operation), and then [conditionally making the field required](#conditionally-making-a-field-required):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->dehydrateStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => Hash::make($state))
    ->dehydrated(fn (?string $state): bool => filled($state))
    ->required(fn (string $operation): bool => $operation === 'create')
```

<Aside variant="info">
    In this example, `Hash::make($state)` shows how to use a [dehydration function](#field-dehydration). However, you don't need to do this if your Model uses `'password' => 'hashed'` in its [casts function — Laravel will handle hashing automatically](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#attribute-casting).
</Aside>

## Saving data to relationships

As well as being able to give structure to fields, [layout components](../schemas/layouts) are also able to "teleport" their nested fields into a relationship. Filament will handle loading data from a `HasOne`, `BelongsTo` or `MorphOne` Eloquent relationship, and then it will save the data back to the same relationship. To set this behavior up, you can use the `relationship()` method on any layout component:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Fieldset;

Fieldset::make('Metadata')
    ->relationship('metadata')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('title'),
        Textarea::make('description'),
        FileUpload::make('image'),
    ])
```

In this example, the `title`, `description` and `image` are automatically loaded from the `metadata` relationship, and saved again when the form is submitted. If the `metadata` record does not exist, it is automatically created.

This functionality is not just limited to fieldsets - you can use it with any layout component. For example, you could use a `Group` component which has no styling associated with it:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Group;

Group::make()
    ->relationship('customer')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->label('Customer')
            ->required(),
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->label('Email address')
            ->email()
            ->required(),
    ])
```

### Saving data to a `BelongsTo` or `MorphTo` relationship

Please note that if you are saving the data to a `BelongsTo` or `MorphTo` relationship, then the foreign key column in your database must be `nullable()`. This is because Filament saves the schema first, before saving the relationship. Since the schema is saved first, the foreign ID does not exist yet, so it must be nullable. Immediately after the schema is saved, Filament saves the relationship, which will then fill in the foreign ID and save it again.

It is worth noting that if you have an observer on your schema model, then you may need to adapt it to ensure that it does not depend on the relationship existing when it is created. For example, if you have an observer that sends an email to a related record when a schema is created, you may need to switch to using a different hook that runs after the relationship is attached, like `updated()`.

#### Specifying the related model for a `MorphTo` relationship

If you are using a `MorphTo` relationship, and you want Filament to be able to create `MorphTo` records instead of just updating them, you need to specify the related model using the `relatedModel` parameter of the `relationship()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Organization;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Group;

Group::make()
    ->relationship('customer', relatedModel: Organization::class)
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

In this example, `customer` is a `MorphTo` relationship, and could be an `Individual` or `Organization`. By specifying the `relatedModel` parameter, Filament will be able to create `Organization` records when the form is submitted. If you do not specify this parameter, Filament will only be able to update existing records.

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">The `relatedModel` parameter also accepts a function that returns the related model class name. This is useful if you want to dynamically determine the related model based on the current state of the form. You can inject various utilities into this function.</UtilityInjection>

### Conditionally saving data to a relationship

Sometimes, saving the related record may be optional. If the user fills out the customer fields, then the customer will be created / updated. Otherwise, the customer will not be created, or will be deleted if it already exists. To do this, you can pass a `condition` function as an argument to `relationship()`, which can use the `$state` of the related form to determine whether the relationship should be saved or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Group;

Group::make()
    ->relationship(
        'customer',
        condition: fn (?array $state): bool => filled($state['name']),
    )
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->label('Customer'),
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->label('Email address')
            ->email()
            ->requiredWith('name'),
    ])
```

In this example, the customer's name is not `required()`, and the email address is only required when the `name` is filled. The `condition` function is used to check whether the `name` field is filled, and if it is, then the customer will be created / updated. Otherwise, the customer will not be created, or will be deleted if it already exists.

## Global settings

If you wish to change the default behavior of a field globally, then you can call the static `configureUsing()` method inside a service provider's `boot()` method or a middleware. Pass a closure which is able to modify the component. For example, if you wish to make all [checkboxes `inline(false)`](checkbox#positioning-the-label-above), you can do it like so:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::configureUsing(function (Checkbox $checkbox): void {
    $checkbox->inline(false);
});
```

Of course, you are still able to overwrite this behavior on each field individually:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_admin')
    ->inline()
```

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

The text input allows you to interact with a string:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/text-input/simple" alt="Text input" version="4.x" />

## Setting the HTML input type

You may set the type of string using a set of methods. Some, such as `email()`, also provide validation:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('text')
    ->email() // or
    ->numeric() // or
    ->integer() // or
    ->password() // or
    ->tel() // or
    ->url()
```

You may instead use the `type()` method to pass another [HTML input type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('backgroundColor')
    ->type('color')
```

The individual type methods also allow you to pass in a boolean value to control if the field should be that or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('text')
    ->email(FeatureFlag::active()) // or
    ->numeric(FeatureFlag::active()) // or
    ->integer(FeatureFlag::active()) // or
    ->password(FeatureFlag::active()) // or
    ->tel(FeatureFlag::active()) // or
    ->url(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value these methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Setting the HTML input mode

You may set the [`inputmode` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#inputmode) of the input using the `inputMode()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('text')
    ->numeric()
    ->inputMode('decimal')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `inputMode()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Setting the numeric step

You may set the [`step` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#step) of the input using the `step()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('number')
    ->numeric()
    ->step(100)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `step()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Autocompleting text

You may allow the text to be [autocompleted by the browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#autocomplete) using the `autocomplete()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->autocomplete('new-password')
```

As a shortcut for `autocomplete="off"`, you may use `autocomplete(false)`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->autocomplete(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `autocomplete()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

For more complex autocomplete options, text inputs also support [datalists](#autocompleting-text-with-a-datalist).

### Autocompleting text with a datalist

You may specify [datalist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) options for a text input using the `datalist()` method:

```php
TextInput::make('manufacturer')
    ->datalist([
        'BMW',
        'Ford',
        'Mercedes-Benz',
        'Porsche',
        'Toyota',
        'Volkswagen',
    ])
```

Datalists provide autocomplete options to users when they use a text input. However, these are purely recommendations, and the user is still able to type any value into the input. If you're looking to strictly limit users to a set of predefined options, check out the [select field](select).

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `datalist()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Autocapitalizing text

You may allow the text to be [autocapitalized by the browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#autocapitalize) using the `autocapitalize()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->autocapitalize('words')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `autocapitalize()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Adding affix text aside the field

You may place text before and after the input using the `prefix()` and `suffix()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('domain')
    ->prefix('https://')
    ->suffix('.com')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `prefix()` and `suffix()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/text-input/affix" alt="Text input with affixes" version="4.x" />

### Using icons as affixes

You may place an [icon](../styling/icons) before and after the input using the `prefixIcon()` and `suffixIcon()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextInput::make('domain')
    ->url()
    ->suffixIcon(Heroicon::GlobeAlt)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `prefixIcon()` and `suffixIcon()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/text-input/suffix-icon" alt="Text input with suffix icon" version="4.x" />

#### Setting the affix icon's color

Affix icons are gray by default, but you may set a different color using the `prefixIconColor()` and `suffixIconColor()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextInput::make('domain')
    ->url()
    ->suffixIcon(Heroicon::CheckCircle)
    ->suffixIconColor('success')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `prefixIconColor()` and `suffixIconColor()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Revealable password inputs

When using `password()`, you can also make the input `revealable()`, so that the user can see a plain text version of the password they're typing by clicking a button:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->revealable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/text-input/revealable-password" alt="Text input with revealable password" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the input should be revealable or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->revealable(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `revealable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Allowing the text to be copied to the clipboard

You may make the text copyable, such that clicking on a button next to the input copies the text to the clipboard, and optionally specify a custom confirmation message and duration in milliseconds:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('apiKey')
    ->label('API key')
    ->copyable(copyMessage: 'Copied!', copyMessageDuration: 1500)
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should be copyable or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('apiKey')
    ->label('API key')
    ->copyable(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `copyable()` method parameters also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="warning">
    This feature only works when SSL is enabled for the app.
</Aside>

## Input masking

Input masking is the practice of defining a format that the input value must conform to.

In Filament, you may use the `mask()` method to configure an [Alpine.js mask](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/mask#x-mask):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('birthday')
    ->mask('99/99/9999')
    ->placeholder('MM/DD/YYYY')
```

To use a [dynamic mask](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/mask#mask-functions), wrap the JavaScript in a `RawJs` object:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Support\RawJs;

TextInput::make('cardNumber')
    ->mask(RawJs::make(<<<'JS'
        $input.startsWith('34') || $input.startsWith('37') ? '9999 999999 99999' : '9999 9999 9999 9999'
    JS))
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `mask()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

Alpine.js will send the entire masked value to the server, so you may need to strip certain characters from the state before validating the field and saving it. You can do this with the `stripCharacters()` method, passing in a character or an array of characters to remove from the masked value:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Support\RawJs;

TextInput::make('amount')
    ->mask(RawJs::make('$money($input)'))
    ->stripCharacters(',')
    ->numeric()
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `stripCharacters()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Trimming whitespace

You can automatically trim whitespace from the beginning and end of the input value using the `trim()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->trim()
```

You may want to enable trimming globally for all text inputs, similar to Laravel's `TrimStrings` middleware. You can do this in a service provider using the `configureUsing()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::configureUsing(function (TextInput $component): void {
    $component->trim();
});
```

## Making the field read-only

Not to be confused with [disabling the field](overview#disabling-a-field), you may make the field "read-only" using the `readOnly()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->readOnly()
```

There are a few differences, compared to [`disabled()`](overview#disabling-a-field):

- When using `readOnly()`, the field will still be sent to the server when the form is submitted. It can be mutated with the browser console, or via JavaScript. You can use [`dehydrated(false)`](overview#preventing-a-field-from-being-dehydrated) to prevent this.
- There are no styling changes, such as less opacity, when using `readOnly()`.
- The field is still focusable when using `readOnly()`.

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the field should be read-only or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->readOnly(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `readOnly()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Text input validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to text inputs.

### Length validation

You may limit the length of the input by setting the `minLength()` and `maxLength()` methods. These methods add both frontend and backend validation:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->minLength(2)
    ->maxLength(255)
```

You can also specify the exact length of the input by setting the `length()`. This method adds both frontend and backend validation:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('code')
    ->length(8)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `minLength()`, `maxLength()` and `length()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Size validation

You may validate the minimum and maximum value of a numeric input by setting the `minValue()` and `maxValue()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('number')
    ->numeric()
    ->minValue(1)
    ->maxValue(100)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `minValue()` and `maxValue()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Phone number validation

When using a `tel()` field, the value will be validated using: `/^[+]*[(]{0,1}[0-9]{1,4}[)]{0,1}[-\s\.\/0-9]*$/`.

If you wish to change that, then you can use the `telRegex()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('phone')
    ->tel()
    ->telRegex('/^[+]*[(]{0,1}[0-9]{1,4}[)]{0,1}[-\s\.\/0-9]*$/')
```

Alternatively, to customize the `telRegex()` across all fields, use a service provider:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::configureUsing(function (TextInput $component): void {
    $component->telRegex('/^[+]*[(]{0,1}[0-9]{1,4}[)]{0,1}[-\s\.\/0-9]*$/');
});
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `telRegex()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

The select component allows you to select from a list of predefined options:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static array, the `options()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/simple" alt="Select" version="4.x" />

## Enabling the JavaScript select

By default, Filament uses the native HTML5 select. You may enable a more customizable JavaScript select using the `native(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->native(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `native()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/javascript" alt="JavaScript select" version="4.x" />

## Searching options

You may enable a search input to allow easier access to many options, using the `searchable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->label('Author')
    ->options(User::query()->pluck('name', 'id'))
    ->searchable()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the input should be searchable or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->label('Author')
    ->options(User::query()->pluck('name', 'id'))
    ->searchable(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `searchable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/searchable" alt="Searchable select" version="4.x" />

### Returning custom search results

If you have lots of options and want to populate them based on a database search or other external data source, you can use the `getSearchResultsUsing()` and `getOptionLabelUsing()` methods instead of `options()`.

The `getSearchResultsUsing()` method accepts a callback that returns search results in `$key => $value` format. The current user's search is available as `$search`, and you should use that to filter your results.

The `getOptionLabelUsing()` method accepts a callback that transforms the selected option `$value` into a label. This is used when the form is first loaded when the user has not made a search yet. Otherwise, the label used to display the currently selected option would not be available.

Both `getSearchResultsUsing()` and `getOptionLabelUsing()` must be used on the select if you want to provide custom search results:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->searchable()
    ->getSearchResultsUsing(fn (string $search): array => User::query()
        ->where('name', 'like', "%{$search}%")
        ->limit(50)
        ->pluck('name', 'id')
        ->all())
    ->getOptionLabelUsing(fn ($value): ?string => User::find($value)?->name),
```

`getOptionLabelUsing()` is crucial, since it provides Filament with the label of the selected option, so it doesn't need to execute a full search to find it. If an option is not valid, it should return `null`.

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Option value;;mixed;;$value;;[<code>getOptionLabelUsing()</code> only] The option value to retrieve the label for.||Option values;;array<mixed>;;$values;;[<code>getOptionLabelsUsing()</code> only] The option values to retrieve the labels for.||Search;;?string;;$search;;[<code>getSearchResultsUsing()</code> only] The current search input value, if the field is searchable.">You can inject various utilities into these functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Setting a custom loading message

When you're using a searchable select or multi-select, you may want to display a custom message while the options are loading. You can do this using the `loadingMessage()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->loadingMessage('Loading authors...')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `loadingMessage()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Setting a custom no search results message

When you're using a searchable select or multi-select, you may want to display a custom message when no search results are found. You can do this using the `noSearchResultsMessage()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->noSearchResultsMessage('No authors found.')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `noSearchResultsMessage()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Setting a custom search prompt

When you're using a searchable select or multi-select, you may want to display a custom message when the user has not yet entered a search term. You can do this using the `searchPrompt()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable(['name', 'email'])
    ->searchPrompt('Search authors by their name or email address')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `searchPrompt()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Setting a custom searching message

When you're using a searchable select or multi-select, you may want to display a custom message while the search results are being loaded. You can do this using the `searchingMessage()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->searchingMessage('Searching authors...')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `searchingMessage()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Tweaking the search debounce

By default, Filament will wait 1000 milliseconds (1 second) before searching for options when the user types in a searchable select or multi-select. It will also wait 1000 milliseconds between searches, if the user is continuously typing into the search input. You can change this using the `searchDebounce()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->searchDebounce(500)
```

Ensure that you are not lowering the debounce too much, as this may cause the select to become slow and unresponsive due to a high number of network requests to retrieve options from server.

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `searchDebounce()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Multi-select

The `multiple()` method on the `Select` component allows you to select multiple values from the list of options:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('technologies')
    ->multiple()
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the input should be multiple or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('technologies')
    ->multiple(FeatureFlag::active())
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `multiple()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/multiple" alt="Multi-select" version="4.x" />

These options are returned in JSON format. If you're saving them using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class App extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'technologies' => 'array',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

If you're [returning custom search results](#returning-custom-search-results), you should define `getOptionLabelsUsing()` instead of `getOptionLabelUsing()`. `$values` will be passed into the callback instead of `$value`, and you should return a `$key => $value` array of labels and their corresponding values:

```php
Select::make('technologies')
    ->multiple()
    ->searchable()
    ->getSearchResultsUsing(fn (string $search): array => Technology::query()
        ->where('name', 'like', "%{$search}%")
        ->limit(50)
        ->pluck('name', 'id')
        ->all())
    ->getOptionLabelsUsing(fn (array $values): array => Technology::query()
        ->whereIn('id', $values)
        ->pluck('name', 'id')
        ->all()),
```

`getOptionLabelsUsing()` is crucial, since it provides Filament with the labels of already-selected options, so it doesn't need to execute a full search to find them. It is also used to [validate](#valid-options-validation-in-rule) that the options that the user has selected are valid. If an option is not valid, it should not be present in the array returned by `getOptionLabelsUsing()`.

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Option values;;array<mixed>;;$values;;[<code>getOptionLabelsUsing()</code> only] The option values to retrieve the labels for.">The `getOptionLabelsUsing()` method can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Grouping options

You can group options together under a label, to organize them better. To do this, you can pass an array of groups to `options()` or wherever you would normally pass an array of options. The keys of the array are used as group labels, and the values are arrays of options in that group:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('status')
    ->searchable()
    ->options([
        'In Process' => [
            'draft' => 'Draft',
            'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        ],
        'Reviewed' => [
            'published' => 'Published',
            'rejected' => 'Rejected',
        ],
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/grouped" alt="Grouped select" version="4.x" />

## Integrating with an Eloquent relationship

You may employ the `relationship()` method of the `Select` to configure a `BelongsTo` relationship to automatically retrieve options from. The `titleAttribute` is the name of a column that will be used to generate a label for each option:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
```

The `multiple()` method may be used in combination with `relationship()` to use a `BelongsToMany` relationship. Filament will load the options from the relationship, and save them back to the relationship's pivot table when the form is submitted. If a `name` is not provided, Filament will use the field name as the relationship name:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('technologies')
    ->multiple()
    ->relationship(titleAttribute: 'name')
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    When using `disabled()` with `multiple()` and `relationship()`, ensure that `disabled()` is called before `relationship()`. This ensures that the `dehydrated()` call from within `relationship()` is not overridden by the call from `disabled()`:
    
    ```php
    use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
    
    Select::make('technologies')
        ->multiple()
        ->disabled()
        ->relationship(titleAttribute: 'name')
    ```
</Aside>

### Searching relationship options across multiple columns

By default, if the select is also searchable, Filament will return search results for the relationship based on the title column of the relationship. If you'd like to search across multiple columns, you can pass an array of columns to the `searchable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable(['name', 'email'])
```

### Preloading relationship options

If you'd like to populate the searchable options from the database when the page is loaded, instead of when the user searches, you can use the `preload()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->preload()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the input should be preloaded or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->preload(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `preload()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Excluding the current record

When working with recursive relationships, you will likely want to remove the current record from the set of results.

This can be easily be done using the `ignoreRecord` argument:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('parent_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'parent', titleAttribute: 'name', ignoreRecord: true)
```

### Customizing the relationship query

You may customize the database query that retrieves options using the third parameter of the `relationship()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(
        name: 'author',
        titleAttribute: 'name',
        modifyQueryUsing: fn (Builder $query) => $query->withTrashed(),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Query;;Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;;$query;;The Eloquent query builder to modify.||Search;;?string;;$search;;The current search input value, if the field is searchable.">The `modifyQueryUsing` argument can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing the relationship option labels

If you'd like to customize the label of each option, maybe to be more descriptive, or to concatenate a first and last name, you could use a virtual column in your database migration:

```php
$table->string('full_name')->virtualAs('concat(first_name, \' \', last_name)');
```

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'full_name')
```

Alternatively, you can use the `getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing()` method to transform an option's Eloquent model into a label:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(
        name: 'author',
        modifyQueryUsing: fn (Builder $query) => $query->orderBy('first_name')->orderBy('last_name'),
    )
    ->getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing(fn (Model $record) => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}")
    ->searchable(['first_name', 'last_name'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Eloquent record;;Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;;$record;;The Eloquent record to get the option label for.">The `getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing()` method can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Saving pivot data to the relationship

If you're using a `multiple()` relationship and your pivot table has additional columns, you can use the `pivotData()` method to specify the data that should be saved in them:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('primaryTechnologies')
    ->relationship(name: 'technologies', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->multiple()
    ->pivotData([
        'is_primary' => true,
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `pivotData()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Creating a new option in a modal

You may define a custom form that can be used to create a new record and attach it to the `BelongsTo` relationship:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->createOptionForm([
        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')
            ->required(),
        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('email')
            ->required()
            ->email(),
    ]),
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Schema;;Filament\Schemas\Schema;;$schema;;The schema object for the form in the modal.">As well as allowing a static value, the `createOptionForm()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/create-option" alt="Select with create option button" version="4.x" />

The form opens in a modal, where the user can fill it with data. Upon form submission, the new record is selected by the field.

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/create-option-modal" alt="Select with create option modal" version="4.x" />

#### Customizing new option creation

You can customize the creation process of the new option defined in the form using the `createOptionUsing()` method, which should return the primary key of the newly created record:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->createOptionForm([
       // ...
    ])
    ->createOptionUsing(function (array $data): int {
        return auth()->user()->team->members()->create($data)->getKey();
    }),
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Data;;array<string, mixed>;;$data;;The data from the form in the modal.||Schema;;Filament\Schemas\Schema;;$schema;;The schema object for the form in the modal.">The `createOptionUsing()` method can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Editing the selected option in a modal

You may define a custom form that can be used to edit the selected record and save it back to the `BelongsTo` relationship:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->editOptionForm([
        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')
            ->required(),
        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('email')
            ->required()
            ->email(),
    ]),
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Schema;;Filament\Schemas\Schema;;$schema;;The schema object for the form in the modal.">As well as allowing a static value, the `editOptionForm()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/edit-option" alt="Select with edit option button" version="4.x" />

The form opens in a modal, where the user can fill it with data. Upon form submission, the data from the form is saved back to the record.

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/edit-option-modal" alt="Select with edit option modal" version="4.x" />

#### Customizing option updates

You can customize the update process of the selected option defined in the form using the `updateOptionUsing()` method. The current Eloquent record being edited can be retrieved using the `getRecord()` method on the schema:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->editOptionForm([
       // ...
    ])
    ->updateOptionUsing(function (array $data, Schema $schema) {
        $schema->getRecord()?->update($data);
    }),
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Data;;array<string, mixed>;;$data;;The data from the form in the modal.||Schema;;Filament\Schemas\Schema;;$schema;;The schema object for the form in the modal.">The `updateOptionUsing()` method can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Handling `MorphTo` relationships

`MorphTo` relationships are special, since they give the user the ability to select records from a range of different models. Because of this, we have a dedicated `MorphToSelect` component which is not actually a select field, rather 2 select fields inside a fieldset. The first select field allows you to select the type, and the second allows you to select the record of that type.

To use the `MorphToSelect`, you must pass `types()` into the component, which tell it how to render options for different types:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MorphToSelect;

MorphToSelect::make('commentable')
    ->types([
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Product::class)
            ->titleAttribute('name'),
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Post::class)
            ->titleAttribute('title'),
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">The `types()` method can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Customizing the option labels for each morphed type

The `titleAttribute()` is used to extract the titles out of each product or post. If you'd like to customize the label of each option, you can use the `getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing()` method to transform the Eloquent model into a label:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MorphToSelect;

MorphToSelect::make('commentable')
    ->types([
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Product::class)
            ->getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing(fn (Product $record): string => "{$record->name} - {$record->slug}"),
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Post::class)
            ->titleAttribute('title'),
    ])
```

#### Customizing the relationship query for each morphed type

You may customize the database query that retrieves options using the `modifyOptionsQueryUsing()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MorphToSelect;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

MorphToSelect::make('commentable')
    ->types([
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Product::class)
            ->titleAttribute('name')
            ->modifyOptionsQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereBelongsTo($this->team)),
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Post::class)
            ->titleAttribute('title')
            ->modifyOptionsQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereBelongsTo($this->team)),
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Eloquent query builder;;Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;;$query;;The query builder to modify.">The `modifyOptionsQueryUsing()` method can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="tip">
    Many of the same options in the select field are available for `MorphToSelect`, including `searchable()`, `preload()`, `native()`, `allowHtml()`, and `optionsLimit()`.
</Aside>

#### Customizing the morph select fields

You may further customize the "key" select field for a specific morph type using the `modifyKeySelectUsing()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MorphToSelect;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

MorphToSelect::make('commentable')
    ->types([
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Product::class)
            ->titleAttribute('name')
            ->modifyKeySelectUsing(fn (Select $select): Select => $select
                ->createOptionForm([
                    TextInput::make('title')
                        ->required(),
                ])
                ->createOptionUsing(function (array $data): int {
                    return Product::create($data)->getKey();
                })),
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Post::class)
            ->titleAttribute('title'),
    ])
```

This is useful if you want to customize the "key" select field for each morphed type individually. If you want to customize the key select for all types, you can use the `modifyKeySelectUsing()` method on the `MorphToSelect` component itself:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MorphToSelect;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

MorphToSelect::make('commentable')
    ->types([
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Product::class)
            ->titleAttribute('name'),
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Post::class)
            ->titleAttribute('title'),
    ])
    ->modifyKeySelectUsing(fn (Select $select): Select => $select->native())
```

You can also modify the "type" select field using the `modifyTypeSelectUsing()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MorphToSelect;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

MorphToSelect::make('commentable')
    ->types([
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Product::class)
            ->titleAttribute('name'),
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Post::class)
            ->titleAttribute('title'),
    ])
    ->modifyTypeSelectUsing(fn (Select $select): Select => $select->native())
```

## Allowing HTML in the option labels

By default, Filament will escape any HTML in the option labels. If you'd like to allow HTML, you can use the `allowHtml()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('technology')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => '<span class="text-blue-500">Tailwind</span>',
        'alpine' => '<span class="text-green-500">Alpine</span>',
        'laravel' => '<span class="text-red-500">Laravel</span>',
        'livewire' => '<span class="text-pink-500">Livewire</span>',
    ])
    ->searchable()
    ->allowHtml()
```

<Aside variant="danger">
    Be aware that you will need to ensure that the HTML is safe to render, otherwise your application will be vulnerable to XSS attacks.
</Aside>

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the input should allow HTML or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('technology')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => '<span class="text-blue-500">Tailwind</span>',
        'alpine' => '<span class="text-green-500">Alpine</span>',
        'laravel' => '<span class="text-red-500">Laravel</span>',
        'livewire' => '<span class="text-pink-500">Livewire</span>',
    ])
    ->searchable()
    ->allowHtml(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `allowHtml()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Wrap or truncate option labels

When using the JavaScript select, labels that exceed the width of the select element will wrap onto multiple lines by default. Alternatively, you may choose to truncate overflowing labels.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('truncate')
    ->wrapOptionLabels(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `wrapOptionLabels()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Disable placeholder selection

You can prevent the placeholder (null option) from being selected using the `selectablePlaceholder(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->default('draft')
    ->selectablePlaceholder(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `selectablePlaceholder()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Disabling specific options

You can disable specific options using the `disableOptionWhen()` method. It accepts a closure, in which you can check if the option with a specific `$value` should be disabled:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->default('draft')
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'published')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Option value;;mixed;;$value;;The value of the option to disable.||Option label;;string | Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable;;$label;;The label of the option to disable.">You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Adding affix text aside the field

You may place text before and after the input using the `prefix()` and `suffix()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('domain')
    ->prefix('https://')
    ->suffix('.com')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `prefix()` and `suffix()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/affix" alt="Select with affixes" version="4.x" />

### Using icons as affixes

You may place an [icon](../styling/icons) before and after the input using the `prefixIcon()` and `suffixIcon()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

Select::make('domain')
    ->suffixIcon(Heroicon::GlobeAlt)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `prefixIcon()` and `suffixIcon()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/suffix-icon" alt="Select with suffix icon" version="4.x" />

#### Setting the affix icon's color

Affix icons are gray by default, but you may set a different color using the `prefixIconColor()` and `suffixIconColor()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

Select::make('domain')
    ->suffixIcon(Heroicon::CheckCircle)
    ->suffixIconColor('success')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `prefixIconColor()` and `suffixIconColor()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Limiting the number of options

You can limit the number of options that are displayed in a searchable select or multi-select using the `optionsLimit()` method. The default is 50:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->optionsLimit(20)
```

Ensure that you are not raising the limit too high, as this may cause the select to become slow and unresponsive due to high in-browser memory usage.

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `optionsLimit()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Boolean options

If you want a simple boolean select, with "Yes" and "No" options, you can use the `boolean()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
```

To customize the "Yes" label, you can use the `trueLabel` argument on the `boolean()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean(trueLabel: 'Absolutely!')
```

To customize the "No" label, you can use the `falseLabel` argument on the `boolean()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean(falseLabel: 'Not at all!')
```

To customize the placeholder that shows when an option has not yet been selected, you can use the `placeholder` argument on the `boolean()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean(placeholder: 'Make your mind up...')
```

## Selecting options from a table in a modal

You can use the `ModalTableSelect` component to open a Filament [table](../tables) in a modal, allowing users to select records from it. This is useful when you have a [relationship](#integrating-with-an-eloquent-relationship) that has a lot of records, and you want users to be able to perform advanced filtering and searching through them.

To use the `ModalTableSelect`, you must have a table configuration class for the model. You can generate one of these classes using the `make:filament-table` command:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

class CategoriesTable
{
    public static function configure(Table $table): Table
    {
        return $table
            ->columns([
                TextColumn::make('name')
                    ->searchable(),
                TextColumn::make('slug')
                    ->searchable(),
            ])
            ->filters([
                SelectFilter::make('parent')
                    ->relationship('parent', 'name')
                    ->searchable()
                    ->preload(),
            ]);
    }
}
```

The class must have a `configure()` method that accepts the `Table` object and returns it. The class name needs to be passed to the `tableConfiguration()` method of the `ModalTableSelect` component:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ModalTableSelect;

ModalTableSelect::make('category_id')
    ->relationship('category', 'name')
    ->tableConfiguration(CategoriesTable::class)
```

You can also use the `multiple()` method with a multiple relationship such as `BelongsToMany`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ModalTableSelect;

ModalTableSelect::make('categories')
    ->relationship('categories', 'name')
    ->multiple()
    ->tableConfiguration(CategoriesTable::class)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">The `tableConfiguration()` method can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing the modal table select actions

You can customize the "Select" button and modal using the [action](../actions) object configuration methods. Passing a function to the `selectAction()` method allows you to modify the `$action` object, for example, to change the button label and the modal heading:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\ModalTableSelect;

ModalTableSelect::make('category_id')
    ->relationship('category', 'name')
    ->tableConfiguration(CategoriesTable::class)
    ->selectAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action
            ->label('Select a category')
            ->modalHeading('Search categories')
            ->modalSubmitActionLabel('Confirm selection'),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Action;;Filament\Actions\Action;;$action;;The action object to customize.">The `selectAction()` method can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing the option labels in the modal table select

The `getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing()` method can be used to customize the label of each selected option. This is useful if you want to display a more descriptive label or concatenate two columns together:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ModalTableSelect;

ModalTableSelect::make('category_id')
    ->relationship('category', 'name')
    ->tableConfiguration(CategoriesTable::class)
    ->getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing(fn (Category $record): string => "{$record->name} ({$record->slug})")
```

### Passing additional arguments to the table in a modal select

You can pass arguments from your form to the table configuration class using the `tableArguments()` method. For example, this can be used to modify the table's query based on previously filled form fields:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\ModalTableSelect;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

ModalTableSelect::make('products')
    ->relationship('products', 'name')
    ->multiple()
    ->tableConfiguration(ProductsTable::class)
    ->tableArguments(function (Get $get): array {
        return [
            'category_id' => $get('category_id'),
            'budget_limit' => $get('budget'),
        ];
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">The `tableArguments()` method can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

In your table configuration class, you can access these arguments using the `$table->getArguments()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TableSelect\Livewire\TableSelectLivewireComponent;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

class ProductsTable
{
    public static function configure(Table $table): Table
    {
        return $table
            ->modifyQueryUsing(function (Builder $query) use ($table): Builder {
                $arguments = $table->getArguments();
            
                if ($categoryId = $arguments['category_id'] ?? null) {
                    $query->where('category_id', $categoryId);
                }
                
                if ($budgetLimit = $arguments['budget_limit'] ?? null) {
                    $query->where('price', '<=', $budgetLimit);
                }
                
                return $query;
            })
            ->columns([
                TextColumn::make('name'),
                TextColumn::make('price')
                    ->money(),
                TextColumn::make('category.name')
                    ->hidden(filled($table->getArguments()['category_id'])),
            ]);
    }
}
```

## Select validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to selects.

### Valid options validation (`in()` rule)

The [`in()`](validation#in) rule ensures that users cannot select an option that is not in the list of options. This is an important rule for data integrity purposes, so Filament applies it by default to all select fields.

<Aside variant="warning">
    Selected option validation is crucial, so we strongly suggest that you [write automated tests](../testing/testing-schemas#testing-form-validation) for your forms to ensure that the validation works as expected.
</Aside>

Since there are many ways for a select field to populate its options, and in many cases the options are not all loaded into the select by default and require searching to retrieve them, Filament uses the presence of a valid "option label" to determine whether the selected value exists. It also checks if that option is [disabled](#disabling-specific-options) or not.

If you are using a custom search query to retrieve options, you should ensure that the `getOptionLabelUsing()` method is defined, so that Filament can validate the selected value against the available options:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->searchable()
    ->getSearchResultsUsing(fn (string $search): array => Author::query()
        ->where('name', 'like', "%{$search}%")
        ->limit(50)
        ->pluck('name', 'id')
        ->all())
    ->getOptionLabelUsing(fn (string $value): ?string => Author::find($value)?->name),
```

The `getOptionLabelUsing()` method should return `null` if the option is not valid, to allow Filament to determine that the selected value is not in the list of options. If the option is valid, it should return the label of the option.

If you are using a `multiple()` select or multi-select, you should define `getOptionLabelsUsing()` instead of `getOptionLabelUsing()`. `$values` will be passed into the callback instead of `$value`, and you should return a `$key => $value` array of labels and their corresponding values:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('technologies')
    ->multiple()
    ->searchable()
    ->getSearchResultsUsing(fn (string $search): array => Technology::query()
        ->where('name', 'like', "%{$search}%")
        ->limit(50)
        ->pluck('name', 'id')
        ->all())
    ->getOptionLabelsUsing(fn (array $values): array => Technology::query()
        ->whereIn('id', $values)
        ->pluck('name', 'id')
        ->all()),
```

If you are using the `relationship()` method, the `getOptionLabelUsing()` or `getOptionLabelsUsing()` methods will be automatically defined for you, so you don't need to worry about them.

### Number of selected items validation

You can validate the minimum and maximum number of items that you can select in a [multi-select](#multi-select) by setting the `minItems()` and `maxItems()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('technologies')
    ->multiple()
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
    ->minItems(1)
    ->maxItems(3)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `minItems()` and `maxItems()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the select action objects

This field uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the `$action` object, which you can use to [customize it](../actions/overview) or [customize its modal](../actions/modals). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

- `createOptionAction()`
- `editOptionAction()`
- `manageOptionActions()` (for customizing both the create and edit option actions at once)

Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->createOptionAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->modalWidth('3xl'),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Action;;Filament\Actions\Action;;$action;;The action object to customize.">The action registration methods can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

The checkbox component, similar to a [toggle](toggle), allows you to interact a boolean value.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_admin')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox/simple" alt="Checkbox" version="4.x" />

If you're saving the boolean value using Eloquent, you should be sure to add a `boolean` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#attribute-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'is_admin' => 'boolean',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Positioning the label above

Checkbox fields have two layout modes, inline and stacked. By default, they are inline.

When the checkbox is inline, its label is adjacent to it:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_admin')
    ->inline()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox/inline" alt="Checkbox with its label inline" version="4.x" />

When the checkbox is stacked, its label is above it:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_admin')
    ->inline(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `inline()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox/not-inline" alt="Checkbox with its label above" version="4.x" />

## Checkbox validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to checkboxes.

### Accepted validation

You may ensure that the checkbox is checked using the `accepted()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('terms_of_service')
    ->accepted()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the validation rule should be applied or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('terms_of_service')
    ->accepted(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `accepted()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Declined validation

You may ensure that the checkbox is not checked using the `declined()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_under_18')
    ->declined()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the validation rule should be applied or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_under_18')
    ->declined(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `declined()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Introduction

The toggle component, similar to a [checkbox](checkbox), allows you to interact a boolean value.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle/simple" alt="Toggle" version="4.x" />

If you're saving the boolean value using Eloquent, you should be sure to add a `boolean` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#attribute-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    /**

    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'is_admin' => 'boolean',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Adding icons to the toggle button

Toggles may also use an [icon](../styling/icons) to represent the "on" and "off" state of the button. To add an icon to the "on" state, use the `onIcon()` method. To add an icon to the "off" state, use the `offIcon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->onIcon(Heroicon::Bolt)
    ->offIcon(Heroicon::User)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `onIcon()` and `offIcon()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle/icons" alt="Toggle icons" version="4.x" />

## Customizing the color of the toggle button

You may also customize the [color](../styling/colors) representing the "on" or "off" state of the toggle. To add a color to the "on" state, use the `onColor()` method. To add a color to the "off" state, use the `offColor()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->onColor('success')
    ->offColor('danger')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `onColor()` and `offColor()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Introduction

The checkbox list component allows you to select multiple values from a list of predefined options:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static array, the `options()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox-list/simple" alt="Checkbox list" version="4.x" />

These options are returned in JSON format. If you're saving them using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class App extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'technologies' => 'array',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Setting option descriptions

You can optionally provide descriptions to each option using the `descriptions()` method. This method accepts an array of plain text strings, or instances of `Illuminate\Support\HtmlString` or `Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable`. This allows you to render HTML, or even markdown, in the descriptions:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
    ->descriptions([
        'tailwind' => 'A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.',
        'alpine' => new HtmlString('A rugged, minimal tool for composing behavior <strong>directly in your markup</strong>.'),
        'laravel' => str('A **web application** framework with expressive, elegant syntax.')->inlineMarkdown()->toHtmlString(),
        'livewire' => 'A full-stack framework for Laravel building dynamic interfaces simple, without leaving the comfort of Laravel.',
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static array, the `descriptions()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox-list/option-descriptions" alt="Checkbox list with option descriptions" version="4.x" />

<Aside variant="info">
    Be sure to use the same `key` in the descriptions array as the `key` in the option array so the right description matches the right option.
</Aside>

## Splitting options into columns

You may split options into columns by using the `columns()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `columns()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox-list/columns" alt="Checkbox list with 2 columns" version="4.x" />

This method accepts the same options as the `columns()` method of the [grid](../schemas/layouts#grid-system). This allows you to responsively customize the number of columns at various breakpoints.

### Setting the grid direction

By default, when you arrange checkboxes into columns, they will be listed in order vertically. If you'd like to list them horizontally, you may use the `gridDirection(GridDirection::Row)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Filament\Support\Enums\GridDirection;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2)
    ->gridDirection(GridDirection::Row)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `gridDirection()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox-list/rows" alt="Checkbox list with 2 rows" version="4.x" />

## Searching options

You may enable a search input to allow easier access to many options, using the `searchable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->searchable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox-list/searchable" alt="Searchable checkbox list" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the options should be searchable or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->searchable(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `searchable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Bulk toggling checkboxes

You may allow users to toggle all checkboxes at once using the `bulkToggleable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->bulkToggleable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox-list/bulk-toggleable" alt="Bulk toggleable checkbox list" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the checkboxes should be bulk toggleable or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->bulkToggleable(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `bulkToggleable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Disabling specific options

You can disable specific options using the `disableOptionWhen()` method. It accepts a closure, in which you can check if the option with a specific `$value` should be disabled:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'livewire')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Option value;;mixed;;$value;;The value of the option to disable.||Option label;;string | Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable;;$label;;The label of the option to disable.">You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

If you want to retrieve the options that have not been disabled, e.g. for validation purposes, you can do so using `getEnabledOptions()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
        'heroicons' => 'SVG icons',
    ])
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'heroicons')
    ->in(fn (CheckboxList $component): array => array_keys($component->getEnabledOptions()))
```

For more information about the `in()` function, please see the [Validation documentation](validation#in).

## Allowing HTML in the option labels

By default, Filament will escape any HTML in the option labels. If you'd like to allow HTML, you can use the `allowHtml()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technology')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => '<span class="text-blue-500">Tailwind</span>',
        'alpine' => '<span class="text-green-500">Alpine</span>',
        'laravel' => '<span class="text-red-500">Laravel</span>',
        'livewire' => '<span class="text-pink-500">Livewire</span>',
    ])
    ->searchable()
    ->allowHtml()
```

<Aside variant="danger">
    Be aware that you will need to ensure that the HTML is safe to render, otherwise your application will be vulnerable to XSS attacks.
</Aside>

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the options should allow HTML or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technology')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => '<span class="text-blue-500">Tailwind</span>',
        'alpine' => '<span class="text-green-500">Alpine</span>',
        'laravel' => '<span class="text-red-500">Laravel</span>',
        'livewire' => '<span class="text-pink-500">Livewire</span>',
    ])
    ->searchable()
    ->allowHtml(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `allowHtml()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Integrating with an Eloquent relationship

> If you're building a form inside your Livewire component, make sure you have set up the [form's model](../components/form#setting-a-form-model). Otherwise, Filament doesn't know which model to use to retrieve the relationship from.

You may employ the `relationship()` method of the `CheckboxList` to point to a `BelongsToMany` relationship. Filament will load the options from the relationship, and save them back to the relationship's pivot table when the form is submitted. The `titleAttribute` is the name of a column that will be used to generate a label for each option:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->relationship(titleAttribute: 'name')
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    When using `disabled()` with `relationship()`, ensure that `disabled()` is called before `relationship()`. This ensures that the `dehydrated()` call from within `relationship()` is not overridden by the call from `disabled()`:
    
    ```php
    use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
    
    CheckboxList::make('technologies')
        ->disabled()
        ->relationship(titleAttribute: 'name')
    ```
</Aside>

### Customizing the relationship query

You may customize the database query that retrieves options using the `modifyOptionsQueryUsing` parameter of the `relationship()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->relationship(
        titleAttribute: 'name',
        modifyQueryUsing: fn (Builder $query) => $query->withTrashed(),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Query;;Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;;$query;;The Eloquent query builder to modify.">The `modifyQueryUsing` argument can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing the relationship option labels

If you'd like to customize the label of each option, maybe to be more descriptive, or to concatenate a first and last name, you could use a virtual column in your database migration:

```php
$table->string('full_name')->virtualAs('concat(first_name, \' \', last_name)');
```

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('authors')
    ->relationship(titleAttribute: 'full_name')
```

Alternatively, you can use the `getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing()` method to transform an option's Eloquent model into a label:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

CheckboxList::make('authors')
    ->relationship(
        modifyQueryUsing: fn (Builder $query) => $query->orderBy('first_name')->orderBy('last_name'),
    )
    ->getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing(fn (Model $record) => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}")
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Eloquent record;;Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;;$record;;The Eloquent record to get the option label for.">The `getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing()` method can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Saving pivot data to the relationship

If your pivot table has additional columns, you can use the `pivotData()` method to specify the data that should be saved in them:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('primaryTechnologies')
    ->relationship(name: 'technologies', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->pivotData([
        'is_primary' => true,
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `pivotData()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Setting a custom no search results message

When you're using a searchable checkbox list, you may want to display a custom message when no search results are found. You can do this using the `noSearchResultsMessage()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->searchable()
    ->noSearchResultsMessage('No technologies found.')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `noSearchResultsMessage()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Setting a custom search prompt

When you're using a searchable checkbox list, you may want to tweak the search input's placeholder when the user has not yet entered a search term. You can do this using the `searchPrompt()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->searchable()
    ->searchPrompt('Search for a technology')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `searchPrompt()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Tweaking the search debounce

By default, Filament will wait 1000 milliseconds (1 second) before searching for options when the user types in a searchable checkbox list. It will also wait 1000 milliseconds between searches if the user is continuously typing into the search input. You can change this using the `searchDebounce()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->searchable()
    ->searchDebounce(500)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `searchDebounce()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the checkbox list action objects

This field uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the `$action` object, which you can use to [customize it](../actions/overview). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

- `selectAllAction()`
- `deselectAllAction()`

Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->selectAllAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Select all technologies'),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Action;;Filament\Actions\Action;;$action;;The action object to customize.">The action registration methods can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

The radio input provides a radio button group for selecting a single value from a list of predefined options:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;

Radio::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published'
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static array, the `options()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/radio/simple" alt="Radio" version="4.x" />

## Setting option descriptions

You can optionally provide descriptions to each option using the `descriptions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;

Radio::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published'
    ])
    ->descriptions([
        'draft' => 'Is not visible.',
        'scheduled' => 'Will be visible.',
        'published' => 'Is visible.'
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static array, the `descriptions()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/radio/option-descriptions" alt="Radio with option descriptions" version="4.x" />

<Aside variant="info">
    Be sure to use the same `key` in the descriptions array as the `key` in the option array so the right description matches the right option.
</Aside>

## Positioning the options inline with each other

You may wish to display the options `inline()` with each other:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;

Radio::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->inline()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/radio/inline" alt="Inline toggle buttons" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the options should be inline or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;

Radio::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->inline(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `inline()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Disabling specific options

You can disable specific options using the `disableOptionWhen()` method. It accepts a closure, in which you can check if the option with a specific `$value` should be disabled:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;

Radio::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'published')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Option value;;mixed;;$value;;The value of the option to disable.||Option label;;string | Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable;;$label;;The label of the option to disable.">You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/radio/disabled-option" alt="Radio with disabled option" version="4.x" />

If you want to retrieve the options that have not been disabled, e.g. for validation purposes, you can do so using `getEnabledOptions()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;

Radio::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'published')
    ->in(fn (Radio $component): array => array_keys($component->getEnabledOptions()))
```

For more information about the `in()` function, please see the [Validation documentation](validation#in).

## Boolean options

If you want a simple boolean radio button group, with "Yes" and "No" options, you can use the `boolean()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;

Radio::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/radio/boolean" alt="Boolean radio" version="4.x" />

To customize the "Yes" label, you can use the `trueLabel` argument on the `boolean()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;

Radio::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean(trueLabel: 'Absolutely!')
```

To customize the "No" label, you can use the `falseLabel` argument on the `boolean()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;

Radio::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean(falseLabel: 'Not at all!')
```

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

The date-time picker provides an interactive interface for selecting a date and/or a time.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
TimePicker::make('alarm_at')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/simple" alt="Date time pickers" version="4.x" />

## Customizing the storage format

You may customize the format of the field when it is saved in your database, using the `format()` method. This accepts a string date format, using [PHP date formatting tokens](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->format('d/m/Y')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `format()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Disabling the seconds input

When using the time picker, you may disable the seconds input using the `seconds(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
    ->seconds(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `seconds()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/without-seconds" alt="Date time picker without seconds" version="4.x" />

## Timezones

If you'd like users to be able to manage dates in their own timezone, you can use the `timezone()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
    ->timezone('America/New_York')
```

While dates will still be stored using the app's configured timezone, the date will now load in the new timezone, and it will be converted back when the form is saved.

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `timezone()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

If you do not pass a `timezone()` to the component, it will use Filament's default timezone. You can set Filament's default timezone using the `FilamentTimezone::set()` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider such as `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentTimezone;

public function boot(): void
{
    FilamentTimezone::set('America/New_York');
}
```

This is useful if you want to set a default timezone for all date-time pickers in your application. It is also used in other places where timezones are used in Filament.

<Aside variant="warning">
    Filament's default timezone will only apply when the field stores a time. If the field stores a date only (`DatePicker` instead of `DateTimePicker` or `TimePicker`), the timezone will not be applied. This is to prevent timezone shifts when storing dates without times.
</Aside>

## Enabling the JavaScript date picker

By default, Filament uses the native HTML5 date picker. You may enable a more customizable JavaScript date picker using the `native(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->native(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `native()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/javascript" alt="JavaScript-based date time picker" version="4.x" />

<Aside variant="info">
    The JavaScript date picker does not support full keyboard input in the same way that the native date picker does. If you require full keyboard input, you should use the native date picker.
</Aside>

### Customizing the display format

You may customize the display format of the field, separately from the format used when it is saved in your database. For this, use the `displayFormat()` method, which also accepts a string date format, using [PHP date formatting tokens](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->native(false)
    ->displayFormat('d/m/Y')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `displayFormat()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/display-format" alt="Date time picker with custom display format" version="4.x" />

You may also configure the locale that is used when rendering the display, if you want to use different locale from your app config. For this, you can use the `locale()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->native(false)
    ->displayFormat('d F Y')
    ->locale('fr')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `locale()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Configuring the time input intervals

You may customize the input interval for increasing/decreasing the hours/minutes /seconds using the `hoursStep()` , `minutesStep()` or `secondsStep()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
    ->native(false)
    ->hoursStep(2)
    ->minutesStep(15)
    ->secondsStep(10)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `hoursStep()`, `minutesStep()`, and `secondsStep()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Configuring the first day of the week

In some countries, the first day of the week is not Monday. To customize the first day of the week in the date picker, use the `firstDayOfWeek()` method on the component. 0 to 7 are accepted values, with Monday as 1 and Sunday as 7 or 0:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
    ->native(false)
    ->firstDayOfWeek(7)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `firstDayOfWeek()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/week-starts-on-sunday" alt="Date time picker where the week starts on Sunday" version="4.x" />

There are additionally convenient helper methods to set the first day of the week more semantically:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
    ->native(false)
    ->weekStartsOnMonday()

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
    ->native(false)
    ->weekStartsOnSunday()
```

### Disabling specific dates

To prevent specific dates from being selected:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('date')
    ->native(false)
    ->disabledDates(['2000-01-03', '2000-01-15', '2000-01-20'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `disabledDates()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/disabled-dates" alt="Date time picker where dates are disabled" version="4.x" />

### Closing the picker when a date is selected

To close the picker when a date is selected, you can use the `closeOnDateSelection()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('date')
    ->native(false)
    ->closeOnDateSelection()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the input should close when a date is selected or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('date')
    ->native(false)
    ->closeOnDateSelection(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `closeOnDateSelection()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Autocompleting dates with a datalist

Unless you're using the [JavaScript date picker](#enabling-the-javascript-date-picker), you may specify [datalist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) options for a date picker using the `datalist()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TimePicker;

TimePicker::make('appointment_at')
    ->datalist([
        '09:00',
        '09:30',
        '10:00',
        '10:30',
        '11:00',
        '11:30',
        '12:00',
    ])
```

Datalists provide autocomplete options to users when they use the picker. However, these are purely recommendations, and the user is still able to type any value into the input. If you're looking to strictly limit users to a set of predefined options, check out the [select field](select).

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `datalist()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Focusing a default calendar date

By default, if the field has no state, opening the calendar panel will open the calendar at the current date. This might not be convenient for situations where you want to open the calendar on a specific date instead. You can use the `defaultFocusedDate()` to set a default focused date on the calendar:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('custom_starts_at')
    ->native(false)
    ->placeholder(now()->startOfMonth())
    ->defaultFocusedDate(now()->startOfMonth())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `defaultFocusedDate()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Adding affix text aside the field

You may place text before and after the input using the `prefix()` and `suffix()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date')
    ->prefix('Starts')
    ->suffix('at midnight')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `prefix()` and `suffix()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/affix" alt="Date time picker with affixes" version="4.x" />

### Using icons as affixes

You may place an [icon](../styling/icons) before and after the input using the `prefixIcon()` and `suffixIcon()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TimePicker;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TimePicker::make('at')
    ->prefixIcon(Heroicon::Play)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `prefixIcon()` and `suffixIcon()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/prefix-icon" alt="Date time picker with prefix icon" version="4.x" />

#### Setting the affix icon's color

Affix icons are gray by default, but you may set a different color using the `prefixIconColor()` and `suffixIconColor()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TimePicker;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TimePicker::make('at')
    ->prefixIcon(Heroicon::CheckCircle)
    ->prefixIconColor('success')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `prefixIconColor()` and `suffixIconColor()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Making the field read-only

Not to be confused with [disabling the field](overview#disabling-a-field), you may make the field "read-only" using the `readonly()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->readonly()
```

Please note that this setting is only enforced on native date pickers. If you're using the [JavaScript date picker](#enabling-the-javascript-date-picker), you'll need to use [`disabled()`](overview#disabling-a-field).

There are a few differences, compared to [`disabled()`](overview#disabling-a-field):

- When using `readOnly()`, the field will still be sent to the server when the form is submitted. It can be mutated with the browser console, or via JavaScript. You can use [`dehydrated(false)`](overview#preventing-a-field-from-being-dehydrated) to prevent this.
- There are no styling changes, such as less opacity, when using `readOnly()`.
- The field is still focusable when using `readOnly()`.

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the field should be read-only or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->readOnly(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `readOnly()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Date-time picker validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to date-time pickers.

### Max date / min date validation

You may restrict the minimum and maximum date that can be selected with the picker. The `minDate()` and `maxDate()` methods accept a `DateTime` instance (e.g. `Carbon`), or a string:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->native(false)
    ->minDate(now()->subYears(150))
    ->maxDate(now())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `minDate()` and `maxDate()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. If the functions return `null`, the validation rule is not applied. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters. </UtilityInjection>

## Introduction

The file upload field is based on [Filepond](https://pqina.nl/filepond).

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/file-upload/simple" alt="File upload" version="4.x" />

<Aside variant="tip">
    Filament also supports [`spatie/laravel-medialibrary`](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-medialibrary). See our [plugin documentation](/plugins/filament-spatie-media-library) for more information.
</Aside>

## Configuring the storage disk and directory

By default, files will be uploaded to the storage disk defined in the [configuration file](../introduction/installation#publishing-configuration). You can also set the `FILESYSTEM_DISK` environment variable to change this.

<Aside variant="tip">
    To correctly preview images and other files, FilePond requires files to be served from the same domain as the app, or the appropriate CORS headers need to be present. Ensure that the `APP_URL` environment variable is correct, or modify the [filesystem](https://laravel.com/docs/filesystem) driver to set the correct URL. If you're hosting files on a separate domain like S3, ensure that CORS headers are set up.
</Aside>

To change the disk and directory for a specific field, and the visibility of files, use the `disk()`, `directory()` and `visibility()` methods. By default, files are uploaded with `private` visibility to your storage disk, unless the disk is set to `public`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->disk('s3')
    ->directory('form-attachments')
    ->visibility('public')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `disk()`, `directory()` and `visibility()` methods accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters. </UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="info">
    It is the responsibility of the developer to delete these files from the disk if they are removed, as Filament is unaware if they are depended on elsewhere. One way to do this automatically is observing a [model event](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#events).
</Aside>

## Uploading multiple files

You may also upload multiple files. This stores URLs in JSON:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if multiple files can be uploaded at once:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `multiple()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

If you're saving the file URLs using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Message extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    { 
        return [
            'attachments' => 'array',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

### Controlling the maximum parallel uploads

You can control the maximum number of parallel uploads using the `maxParallelUploads()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->maxParallelUploads(1)
```

This will limit the number of parallel uploads to `1`. If unset, we'll use the [default FilePond value](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/instance/properties/#core-properties) which is `2`.

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `maxParallelUploads()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Controlling file names

By default, a random file name will be generated for newly-uploaded files. This is to ensure that there are never any conflicts with existing files.

### Security implications of controlling file names

Before using the `preserveFilenames()` or `getUploadedFileNameForStorageUsing()` methods, please be aware of the security implications. If you allow users to upload files with their own file names, there are ways that they can exploit this to upload malicious files. **This applies even if you use the [`acceptedFileTypes()`](#file-type-validation) method** to restrict the types of files that can be uploaded, since it uses Laravel's `mimetypes` rule which does not validate the extension of the file, only its mime type, which could be manipulated.

This is specifically an issue with the `getClientOriginalName()` method on the `TemporaryUploadedFile` object, which the `preserveFilenames()` method uses. By default, Livewire generates a random file name for each file uploaded, and uses the mime type of the file to determine the file extension.

Using these methods **with the `local` or `public` filesystem disks** will make your app vulnerable to remote code execution if the attacker uploads a PHP file with a deceptive mime type. **Using an S3 disk protects you from this specific attack vector**, as S3 will not execute PHP files in the same way that your server might when serving files from local storage.

If you are using the `local` or `public` disk, you should consider using the [`storeFileNamesIn()` method](#storing-original-file-names-independently) to store the original file names in a separate column in your database, and keep the randomly generated file names in the file system. This way, you can still display the original file names to users, while keeping the file system secure.

On top of this security issue, you should also be aware that allowing users to upload files with their own file names can lead to conflicts with existing files, and can make it difficult to manage your storage. Users could upload files with the same name and overwrite the other's content if you do not scope them to a specific directory, so these features should in all cases only be accessible to trusted users.

### Preserving original file names

<Aside variant="danger">
    Before using this feature, please ensure that you have read the [security implications](#security-implications-of-controlling-file-names).
</Aside>

To preserve the original filenames of the uploaded files, use the `preserveFilenames()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->preserveFilenames()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the original file names should be preserved:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->preserveFilenames(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `preserveFilenames()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Generating custom file names

<Aside variant="danger">
    Before using this feature, please ensure that you have read the [security implications](#security-implications-of-controlling-file-names).
</Aside>

You may completely customize how file names are generated using the `getUploadedFileNameForStorageUsing()` method, and returning a string from the closure based on the `$file` that was uploaded:

```php
use Livewire\Features\SupportFileUploads\TemporaryUploadedFile;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->getUploadedFileNameForStorageUsing(
        fn (TemporaryUploadedFile $file): string => (string) str($file->getClientOriginalName())
            ->prepend('custom-prefix-'),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="File;;Livewire\Features\SupportFileUploads\TemporaryUploadedFile;;$file;;The temporary file object being uploaded.">You can inject various utilities into the function passed to `getUploadedFileNameForStorageUsing()` as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Storing original file names independently

You can keep the randomly generated file names, while still storing the original file name, using the `storeFileNamesIn()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->storeFileNamesIn('attachment_file_names')
```

`attachment_file_names` will now store the original file names of your uploaded files, so you can save them to the database when the form is submitted. If you're uploading `multiple()` files, make sure that you add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to this Eloquent model property too.

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `storeFileNamesIn()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Avatar mode

You can enable avatar mode for your file upload field using the `avatar()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('avatar')
    ->avatar()
```

This will only allow images to be uploaded, and when they are, it will display them in a compact circle layout that is perfect for avatars.

This feature pairs well with the [circle cropper](#allowing-users-to-crop-images-as-a-circle).

## Image editor

You can enable an image editor for your file upload field using the `imageEditor()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageEditor()
```

You can open the editor once you upload an image by clicking the pencil icon. You can also open the editor by clicking the pencil icon on an existing image, which will remove and re-upload it on save.

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the image editor is enabled:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageEditor(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `imageEditor()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Allowing users to crop images to aspect ratios

You can allow users to crop images to a set of specific aspect ratios using the `imageEditorAspectRatios()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageEditor()
    ->imageEditorAspectRatios([
        '16:9',
        '4:3',
        '1:1',
    ])
```

You can also allow users to choose no aspect ratio, "free cropping", by passing `null` as an option:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageEditor()
    ->imageEditorAspectRatios([
        null,
        '16:9',
        '4:3',
        '1:1',
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `imageEditorAspectRatios()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Setting the image editor's mode

You can change the mode of the image editor using the `imageEditorMode()` method, which accepts either `1`, `2` or `3`. These options are explained in the [Cropper.js documentation](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs#viewmode):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageEditor()
    ->imageEditorMode(2)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `imageEditorMode()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing the image editor's empty fill color

By default, the image editor will make the empty space around the image transparent. You can customize this using the `imageEditorEmptyFillColor()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageEditor()
    ->imageEditorEmptyFillColor('#000000')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `imageEditorEmptyFillColor()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Setting the image editor's viewport size

You can change the size of the image editor's viewport using the `imageEditorViewportWidth()` and `imageEditorViewportHeight()` methods, which generate an aspect ratio to use across device sizes:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageEditor()
    ->imageEditorViewportWidth('1920')
    ->imageEditorViewportHeight('1080')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `imageEditorViewportWidth()` and `imageEditorViewportHeight()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Allowing users to crop images as a circle

You can allow users to crop images as a circle using the `circleCropper()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->avatar()
    ->imageEditor()
    ->circleCropper()
```

This is perfectly accompanied by the [`avatar()` method](#avatar-mode), which renders the images in a compact circle layout.

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the circle cropper is enabled:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->avatar()
    ->imageEditor()
    ->circleCropper(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `circleCropper()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Cropping and resizing images without the editor

Filepond allows you to crop and resize images before they are uploaded, without the need for a separate editor. You can customize this behavior using the `imageCropAspectRatio()`, `imageResizeTargetHeight()` and `imageResizeTargetWidth()` methods. `imageResizeMode()` should be set for these methods to have an effect - either [`force`, `cover`, or `contain`](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/plugins/image-resize).

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageResizeMode('cover')
    ->imageCropAspectRatio('16:9')
    ->imageResizeTargetWidth('1920')
    ->imageResizeTargetHeight('1080')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `imageResizeMode()`, `imageCropAspectRatio()`, `imageResizeTargetHeight()` and `imageResizeTargetWidth()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Altering the appearance of the file upload area

You may also alter the general appearance of the Filepond component. Available options for these methods are available on the [Filepond website](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/instance/properties/#styles).

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->imagePreviewHeight('250')
    ->loadingIndicatorPosition('left')
    ->panelAspectRatio('2:1')
    ->panelLayout('integrated')
    ->removeUploadedFileButtonPosition('right')
    ->uploadButtonPosition('left')
    ->uploadProgressIndicatorPosition('left')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, these methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Displaying files in a grid

You can use the [Filepond `grid` layout](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/style/#grid-layout) by setting the `panelLayout()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->panelLayout('grid')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `panelLayout()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Reordering files

You can also allow users to re-order uploaded files using the `reorderable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->reorderable()
```

When using this method, FilePond may add newly-uploaded files to the beginning of the list, instead of the end. To fix this, use the `appendFiles()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->reorderable()
    ->appendFiles()
```

Optionally, the `reorderable()` and `appendFiles()` methods accept a boolean value to control if the files can be reordered and if new files should be appended to the end of the list:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->reorderable(FeatureFlag::active())
    ->appendFiles(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `reorderable()` and `appendFiles()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Opening files in a new tab

You can add a button to open each file in a new tab with the `openable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->openable()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the files can be opened in a new tab:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->openable(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `openable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Downloading files

If you wish to add a download button to each file instead, you can use the `downloadable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->downloadable()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the files can be downloaded:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->downloadable(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `downloadable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Previewing files

By default, some file types can be previewed in FilePond. If you wish to disable the preview for all files, you can use the `previewable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->previewable(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `previewable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Moving files instead of copying when the form is submitted

By default, files are initially uploaded to Livewire's temporary storage directory, and then copied to the destination directory when the form is submitted. If you wish to move the files instead, providing that temporary uploads are stored on the same disk as permanent files, you can use the `moveFiles()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->moveFiles()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the files should be moved:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->moveFiles(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `moveFiles()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Preventing files from being stored permanently

If you wish to prevent files from being stored permanently when the form is submitted, you can use the `storeFiles(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->storeFiles(false)
```

When the form is submitted, a temporary file upload object will be returned instead of a permanently stored file path. This is perfect for temporary files like imported CSVs.

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `storeFiles()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="warning">
    Images, video and audio files will not show the stored file name in the form's preview, unless you use [`previewable(false)`](#previewing-files). This is due to a limitation with the FilePond preview plugin.
</Aside>

## Orienting images from their EXIF data

By default, FilePond will automatically orient images based on their EXIF data. If you wish to disable this behavior, you can use the `orientImagesFromExif(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->orientImagesFromExif(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `orientImagesFromExif()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Hiding the remove file button

It is also possible to hide the remove uploaded file button by using `deletable(false)`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->deletable(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `deletable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Preventing pasting files

You can disable the ability to paste files via the clipboard using the `pasteable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->pasteable(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `pasteable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Preventing file information fetching

While the form is loaded, it will automatically detect whether the files exist, what size they are, and what type of files they are. This is all done on the backend. When using remote storage with many files, this can be time-consuming. You can use the `fetchFileInformation(false)` method to disable this feature:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->fetchFileInformation(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `fetchFileInformation()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the uploading message

You may customize the uploading message that is displayed in the form's submit button using the `uploadingMessage()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->uploadingMessage('Uploading attachment...')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `uploadingMessage()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## File upload validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to file uploads.

Since Filament is powered by Livewire and uses its file upload system, you will want to refer to the default Livewire file upload validation rules in the `config/livewire.php` file as well. This also controls the 12MB file size maximum.

### File type validation

You may restrict the types of files that may be uploaded using the `acceptedFileTypes()` method, and passing an array of MIME types.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('document')
    ->acceptedFileTypes(['application/pdf'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `acceptedFileTypes()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

You may also use the `image()` method as shorthand to allow all image MIME types.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
```

#### Custom MIME type mapping

Some file formats may not be recognized correctly by the browser when uploading files. Filament allows you to manually define MIME types for specific file extensions using the `mimeTypeMap()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('designs')
    ->acceptedFileTypes([
        'x-world/x-3dmf',
        'application/vnd.sketchup.skp',
    ])
    ->mimeTypeMap([
        '3dm' => 'x-world/x-3dmf',
        'skp' => 'application/vnd.sketchup.skp',
    ]);
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `mimeTypeMap()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### File size validation

You may also restrict the size of uploaded files in kilobytes:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->minSize(512)
    ->maxSize(1024)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `minSize()` and `maxSize()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Uploading large files

If you experience issues when uploading large files, such as HTTP requests failing with a response status of 422 in the browser's console, you may need to tweak your configuration.

In the `php.ini` file for your server, increasing the maximum file size may fix the issue:

```ini
post_max_size = 120M
upload_max_filesize = 120M
```

Livewire also validates file size before uploading. To publish the Livewire config file, run:

```bash
php artisan livewire:publish --config
```

The [max upload size can be adjusted in the `rules` key of `temporary_file_upload`](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/uploads#global-validation). In this instance, KB are used in the rule, and 120MB is 122880KB:

```php
'temporary_file_upload' => [
    // ...
    'rules' => ['required', 'file', 'max:122880'],
    // ...
],
```

### Number of files validation

You may customize the number of files that may be uploaded, using the `minFiles()` and `maxFiles()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->minFiles(2)
    ->maxFiles(5)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `minFiles()` and `maxFiles()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Introduction

The rich editor allows you to edit and preview HTML content, as well as upload images. It uses [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev) as the underlying editor.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/rich-editor/simple" alt="Rich editor" version="4.x" />

## Storing content as JSON

By default, the rich editor stores content as HTML. If you would like to store the content as JSON instead, you can use the `json()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
    ->json()
```

The JSON is in [TipTap's](https://tiptap.dev) format, which is a structured representation of the content.

If you're saving the JSON tags using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'content' => 'array',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Customizing the toolbar buttons

You may set the toolbar buttons for the editor using the `toolbarButtons()` method. The options shown here are the defaults:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
    ->toolbarButtons([
        ['bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'strike', 'subscript', 'superscript', 'link'],
        ['h2', 'h3', 'alignStart', 'alignCenter', 'alignEnd'],
        ['blockquote', 'codeBlock', 'bulletList', 'orderedList'],
        ['table', 'attachFiles'], // The `customBlocks` and `mergeTags` tools are also added here if those features are used.
        ['undo', 'redo'],
    ])
```

Each nested array in the main array represents a group of buttons in the toolbar.

Additional tools available in the toolbar include:

- `h1` - Applies the "h1" tag to the text.
- `alignJustify` - Justifies the text.
- `clearFormatting` - Clears all formatting from the selected text.
- `details` - Inserts a `<details>` tag, which allows users to create collapsible sections in their content.
- `highlight` - Highlights the selected text with a `<mark>` tag around it.
- `horizontalRule` - Inserts a horizontal rule.
- `lead` - Applies a `lead` class around the text, which is typically used for the first paragraph of an article.
- `small` - Applies the `<small>` tag to the text, which is typically used for small print or disclaimers.
- `code` - Format the selected text as inline code.
- `table` - Creates a table in the editor with a default layout of 3 columns and 2 rows, with the first row configured as a header row.
- `tableAddColumnBefore` - Adds a new column before the current column.
- `tableAddColumnAfter` - Adds a new column after the current column.
- `tableDeleteColumn` - Deletes the current column.
- `tableAddRowBefore` - Adds a new row above the current row.
- `tableAddRowAfter` - Adds a new row below the current row.
- `tableDeleteRow` - Deletes the current row.
- `tableMergeCells` - Merges the selected cells into one cell.
- `tableSplitCell` - Splits the selected cell into multiple cells.
- `tableToggleHeaderRow` - Toggles the header row of the table.
- `tableDelete` - Deletes the table.

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `toolbarButtons()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing floating toolbars

If your toolbar is too full, you can use a floating toolbar to show certain tools in a toolbar below the cursor, only when the user is inside a specific node type. This allows you to keep the main toolbar clean while still providing access to additional tools when needed.

You can customize the floating toolbars that appear when your cursor is placed inside a specific node by using the `floatingToolbars()` method.

In the example below, a floating toolbar appears when the cursor is inside a paragraph node. It shows bold, italic, and similar buttons. When the cursor is in a heading node, it displays heading-related buttons, and when inside a table, it shows table-specific controls.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
    ->floatingToolbars([
        'paragraph' => [
            'bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'strike', 'subscript', 'superscript',
        ],
        'heading' => [
            'h1', 'h2', 'h3',
        ],
        'table' => [
            'tableAddColumnBefore', 'tableAddColumnAfter', 'tableDeleteColumn',
            'tableAddRowBefore', 'tableAddRowAfter', 'tableDeleteRow',
            'tableMergeCells', 'tableSplitCell',
            'tableToggleHeaderRow',
            'tableDelete',
        ],
    ])
```

## Rendering rich content

If you're [storing content as JSON](#storing-content-as-json) instead of HTML, or your content requires processing to inject [private image URLs](#using-private-images-in-the-editor) or similar, you'll need to use the `RichContentRenderer` tool in Filament to output HTML:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentRenderer;

RichContentRenderer::make($record->content)->toHtml()
```

The `toHtml()` method returns a string. If you would like to output HTML in a Blade view without escaping the HTML, you can echo the `RichContentRender` object without calling `toHtml()`:

```blade
{{ \Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentRenderer::make($record->content) }}
```

If you have configured the [file attachments behavior](#uploading-images-to-the-editor) of the editor to change the disk or visibility of the uploaded files, you must also pass these settings to the renderer to ensure that the correct URLs are generated:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentRenderer;

RichContentRenderer::make($record->content)
    ->fileAttachmentsDisk('s3')
    ->fileAttachmentsVisibility('private')
    ->toHtml()
```

If you are using [custom blocks](#using-custom-blocks) in the rich editor, you can pass an array of custom blocks to the renderer to ensure that they are rendered correctly:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentRenderer;

RichContentRenderer::make($record->content)
    ->customBlocks([
        HeroBlock::class => [
            'categoryUrl' => $record->category->getUrl(),
        ],
        CallToActionBlock::class,
    ])
    ->toHtml()
```

If you are using [merge tags](#using-merge-tags), you can pass an array of values to replace the merge tags with:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentRenderer;

RichContentRenderer::make($record->content)
    ->mergeTags([
        'name' => $record->user->name,
        'today' => now()->toFormattedDateString(),
    ])
    ->toHtml()
```

## Security

By default, the editor outputs raw HTML, and sends it to the backend. Attackers are able to intercept the value of the component and send a different raw HTML string to the backend. As such, it is important that when outputting the HTML from a rich editor, it is sanitized; otherwise your site may be exposed to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

When Filament outputs raw HTML from the database in components such as `TextColumn` and `TextEntry`, it sanitizes it to remove any dangerous JavaScript. However, if you are outputting the HTML from a rich editor in your own Blade view, this is your responsibility. One option is to use Filament's `sanitizeHtml()` helper to do this, which is the same tool we use to sanitize HTML in the components mentioned above:

```blade
{!! str($record->content)->sanitizeHtml() !!}
```

If you're [storing content as JSON](#storing-content-as-json) instead of HTML, or your content requires processing to inject [private image URLs](#using-private-images-in-the-editor) or similar, you can use the [content renderer](#rendering-rich-content) to output HTML. This will automatically sanitize the HTML for you, so you don't need to worry about it.

## Uploading images to the editor

By default, uploaded images are stored publicly on your storage disk, so that the rich content stored in the database can be output easily anywhere. You may customize how images are uploaded using configuration methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
    ->fileAttachmentsDisk('s3')
    ->fileAttachmentsDirectory('attachments')
    ->fileAttachmentsVisibility('private')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `fileAttachmentsDisk()`, `fileAttachmentsDirectory()`, and `fileAttachmentsVisibility()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="tip">
    Filament also supports [`spatie/laravel-medialibrary`](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-medialibrary) for storing rich editor file attachments. See our [plugin documentation](/plugins/filament-spatie-media-library#using-media-library-for-rich-editor-file-attachments) for more information.
</Aside>

### Using private images in the editor

Using private images in the editor adds a layer of complexity to the process, since private images cannot be accessed directly via a permanent URL. Each time the editor is loaded or its content is rendered, temporary URLs need to be generated for each image, which are never stored in the database. Instead, Filament adds a `data-id` attribute to the image tags, which contains an identifier for the image in the storage disk, so that a temporary URL can be generated on demand.

When rendering the content using private images, ensure that you are using the [`RichContentRenderer` tool](#rendering-rich-content) in Filament to output HTML:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentRenderer;

RichContentRenderer::make($record->content)
    ->fileAttachmentsDisk('s3')
    ->fileAttachmentsVisibility('private')
    ->toHtml()
```

## Using custom blocks

Custom blocks are elements that users can drag and drop into the rich editor. You can define custom blocks that user can insert into the rich editor using the `customBlocks()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
    ->customBlocks([
        HeroBlock::class,
        CallToActionBlock::class,
    ])
```

To create a custom block, you can use the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-rich-content-custom-block HeroBlock
```

Each block needs a corresponding class that extends the `Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentCustomBlock` class. The `getId()` method should return a unique identifier for the block, and the `getLabel()` method should return the label that will be displayed in the editor's side panel:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentCustomBlock;

class HeroBlock extends RichContentCustomBlock
{
    public static function getId(): string
    {
        return 'hero';
    }

    public static function getLabel(): string
    {
        return 'Hero section';
    }
}
```

When a user drags a custom block into the editor, you can choose to open a modal to collect additional information from the user before inserting the block. To do this, you can use the `configureEditorAction()` method to configure the [modal](../actions/modals) that will be opened when the block is inserted:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentCustomBlock;

class HeroBlock extends RichContentCustomBlock
{
    // ...

    public static function configureEditorAction(Action $action): Action
    {
        return $action
            ->modalDescription('Configure the hero section')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('heading')
                    ->required(),
                TextInput::make('subheading'),
            ]);
    }
}
```

The `schema()` method on the action can define form fields that will be displayed in the modal. When the user submits the form, the form data will be saved as "configuration" for that block.

### Rendering a preview for a custom block

Once a block is inserted into the editor, you may define a "preview" for it using the `toPreviewHtml()` method. This method should return a string of HTML that will be displayed in the editor when the block is inserted, allowing users to see what the block will look like before they save it. You can access the `$config` for the block in this method, which contains the data that was submitted in the modal when the block was inserted:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentCustomBlock;

class HeroBlock extends RichContentCustomBlock
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @param  array<string, mixed>  $config
     */
    public static function toPreviewHtml(array $config): string
    {
        return view('filament.forms.components.rich-editor.rich-content-custom-blocks.hero.preview', [
            'heading' => $config['heading'],
            'subheading' => $config['subheading'] ?? 'Default subheading',
        ])->render();
    }
}
```

The `getPreviewLabel()` can be defined if you would like to customize the label that is displayed above the preview in the editor. By default, it will use the label defined in the `getLabel()` method, but the `getPreviewLabel()` is able to access the `$config` for the block, allowing you to display dynamic information in the label:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentCustomBlock;

class HeroBlock extends RichContentCustomBlock
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @param  array<string, mixed>  $config
     */
    public static function getPreviewLabel(array $config): string
    {
        return "Hero section: {$config['heading']}";
    }
}
```

### Rendering content with custom blocks

When rendering the rich content, you can pass the array of custom blocks to the `RichContentRenderer` to ensure that the blocks are rendered correctly:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentRenderer;

RichContentRenderer::make($record->content)
    ->customBlocks([
        HeroBlock::class,
        CallToActionBlock::class,
    ])
    ->toHtml()
```

Each block class may have a `toHtml()` method that returns the HTML that should be rendered for that block:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentCustomBlock;

class HeroBlock extends RichContentCustomBlock
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @param  array<string, mixed>  $config
     * @param  array<string, mixed>  $data
     */
    public static function toHtml(array $config, array $data): string
    {
        return view('filament.forms.components.rich-editor.rich-content-custom-blocks.hero.index', [
            'heading' => $config['heading'],
            'subheading' => $config['subheading'],
            'buttonLabel' => 'View category',
            'buttonUrl' => $data['categoryUrl'],
        ])->render();
    }
}
```

As seen above, the `toHtml()` method receives two parameters: `$config`, which contains the configuration data submitted in the modal when the block was inserted, and `$data`, which contains any additional data that may be needed to render the block. This allows you to access the configuration data and render the block accordingly. The data can be passed in the `customBlocks()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentRenderer;

RichContentRenderer::make($record->content)
    ->customBlocks([
        HeroBlock::class => [
            'categoryUrl' => $record->category->getUrl(),
        ],
        CallToActionBlock::class,
    ])
    ->toHtml()
```

### Opening the custom blocks panel by default

If you want the custom blocks panel to be open by default when the rich editor is loaded, you can use the `activePanel('customBlocks')` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
    ->customBlocks([
        HeroBlock::class,
        CallToActionBlock::class,
    ])
    ->activePanel('customBlocks')
```

## Using merge tags

Merge tags allow the user to insert "placeholders" into their rich content, which can be replaced with dynamic values when the content is rendered. This is useful for inserting things like the current user's name, or the current date.

To register merge tags on an editor, use the `mergeTags()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
    ->mergeTags([
        'name',
        'today',
    ])
```

Merge tags are surrounded by double curly braces, like `{{ name }}`. When the content is rendered, these tags will be replaced with the corresponding values.

To insert a merge tag into the content, users can start typing `{{` to search for a tag to insert. Alternatively, they can click on the "merge tags" tool in the editor's toolbar, which opens a panel containing all the merge tags. They can then drag a merge tag from the editor's side panel into the content or click to insert it.

### Rendering content with merge tags

When rendering the rich content, you can pass an array of values to replace the merge tags with:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentRenderer;

RichContentRenderer::make($record->content)
    ->mergeTags([
        'name' => $record->user->name,
        'today' => now()->toFormattedDateString(),
    ])
    ->toHtml()
```

If you have many merge tags or you need to run some logic to determine the values, you can use a function as the value of each merge tag. This function will be called when a merge tag is first encountered in the content, and its result is cached for subsequent tags of the same name:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentRenderer;

RichContentRenderer::make($record->content)
    ->mergeTags([
        'name' => fn (): string => $record->user->name,
        'today' => now()->toFormattedDateString(),
    ])
    ->toHtml()
```

### Opening the merge tags panel by default

If you want the merge tags panel to be open by default when the rich editor is loaded, you can use the `activePanel('mergeTags')` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
    ->mergeTags([
        'name',
        'today',
    ])
    ->activePanel('mergeTags')
```

## Registering rich content attributes

There are elements of the rich editor configuration that apply to both the editor and the renderer. For example, if you are using [private images](#using-private-images-in-the-editor), [custom blocks](#using-custom-blocks), [merge tags](#using-merge-tags), or [plugins](#extending-the-rich-editor), you need to ensure that the same configuration is used in both places. To do this, Filament provides you with a way to register rich content attributes that can be used in both the editor and the renderer.

To register rich content attributes on an Eloquent model, you should use the `InteractsWithRichContent` trait and implement the `HasRichContent` interface. This allows you to register the attributes in the `setUpRichContent()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\Models\Concerns\InteractsWithRichContent;
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\Models\Contracts\HasRichContent;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model implements HasRichContent
{
    use InteractsWithRichContent;

    public function setUpRichContent(): void
    {
        $this->registerRichContent('content')
            ->fileAttachmentsDisk('s3')
            ->fileAttachmentsVisibility('private')
            ->customBlocks([
                HeroBlock::class => [
                    'categoryUrl' => fn (): string => $this->category->getUrl(),
                ],
                CallToActionBlock::class,
            ])
            ->mergeTags([
                'name' => fn (): string => $this->user->name,
                'today' => now()->toFormattedDateString(),
            ])
            ->plugins([
                HighlightRichContentPlugin::make(),
            ]);
    }
}
```

Whenever you use the `RichEditor` component, the configuration registered for the corresponding attribute will be used:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
```

To easily render the rich content HTML from a model with the given configuration, you can call the `renderRichContent()` method on the model, passing the name of the attribute:

```blade
{!! $record->renderRichContent('content') !!}
```

Alternatively, you can get an `Htmlable` object to render without escaping the HTML:

```blade
{{ $record->getRichContentAttribute('content') }}
```

When using a [text column](../tables/columns/text) in a table or a [text entry](../infolists/text-entry) in an infolist, you don't need to manually render the rich content. Filament will do this for you automatically:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('content')

TextEntry::make('content')
```

## Extending the rich editor

You can create plugins for the rich editor, which allow you to add custom TipTap extensions to the editor and renderer, as well as custom toolbar buttons. Create a new class that implements the `RichContentPlugin` interface:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\ColorPicker;
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\EditorCommand;
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\Plugins\Contracts\RichContentPlugin;
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichEditorTool;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Width;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;
use Tiptap\Core\Extension;
use Tiptap\Marks\Highlight;

class HighlightRichContentPlugin implements RichContentPlugin
{
    public static function make(): static
    {
        return app(static::class);
    }

    /**
     * @return array<Extension>
     */
    public function getTipTapPhpExtensions(): array
    {
        // This method should return an array of PHP TipTap extension objects.
        // See: https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap-php
    
        return [
            app(Highlight::class, [
                'options' => ['multicolor' => true],
            ]),
        ];
    }

    /**
     * @return array<string>
     */
    public function getTipTapJsExtensions(): array
    {
        // This method should return an array of URLs to JavaScript files containing
        // TipTap extensions that should be asynchronously loaded into the editor
        // when the plugin is used.
    
        return [
            FilamentAsset::getScriptSrc('rich-content-plugins/highlight'),
        ];
    }

    /**
     * @return array<RichEditorTool>
     */
    public function getEditorTools(): array
    {
        // This method should return an array of `RichEditorTool` objects, which can then be
        // used in the `toolbarButtons()` of the editor.
        
        // The `jsHandler()` method allows you to access the TipTap editor instance
        // through `$getEditor()`, and `chain()` any TipTap commands to it.
        // See: https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/api/commands
        
        // The `action()` method allows you to run an action (registered in the `getEditorActions()`
        // method) when the toolbar button is clicked. This allows you to open a modal to

                ->action(arguments: '{ color: $getEditor().getAttributes(\'mark\')?.data-color }')
                ->icon(Heroicon::CursorArrowRipple),

        // to apply the commands to.
    
        return [
            Action::make('highlightWithCustomColor')
                ->modalWidth(Width::Large)
                ->fillForm(fn (array $arguments): array => [
                    'color' => $arguments['color'] ?? null,

                ->action(function (array $arguments, array $data, RichEditor $component): void {
                    $component->runCommands(
                        [
                            EditorCommand::make(
                                'toggleHighlight',
                                arguments: [[
                                    'color' => $data['color'],
                                ]],
                            ),
                        ],
                        editorSelection: $arguments['editorSelection'],
                    );
                }),
        ];
    }
}
```

You can use the `plugins()` method to register your plugin with the rich editor and [rich content renderer](#rendering-rich-content):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor\RichContentRenderer;

RichEditor::make('content')
    ->toolbarButtons([
        ['bold', 'highlight', 'highlightWithCustomColor'],
        ['h2', 'h3'],
        ['bulletList', 'orderedList'],
    ])
    ->plugins([
        HighlightRichContentPlugin::make(),
    ])

RichContentRenderer::make($record->content)
    ->plugins([
        HighlightRichContentPlugin::make(),
    ])
```

### Setting up a TipTap JavaScript extension

Filament is able to asynchronously load JavaScript extensions for TipTap. To do this, you need to create a JavaScript file that contains the extension, and register it in the `getTipTapJsExtensions()` method of your [plugin](#extending-the-rich-editor).

For instance, if you wanted to use the [TipTap highlight extension](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/marks/highlight), make sure it is installed first:

```bash
npm install @tiptap/extension-highlight --save-dev
```

Then, create a JavaScript file that imports the extension. In this example, create a file called `highlight.js` in the `resources/js/filament/rich-content-plugins` directory, and add the following code to it:

```javascript
import Highlight from '@tiptap/extension-highlight'

export default Highlight.configure({
    multicolor: true,
})
```

One way to compile this file is to use [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io). You can install it using `npm`:

```bash
npm install esbuild --save-dev
```

You must create an [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) script to compile the file. You can put this anywhere, for example `bin/build.js`:

```js
import * as esbuild from 'esbuild'

async function compile(options) {
    const context = await esbuild.context(options)

    await context.rebuild()
    await context.dispose()
}

compile({
    define: {
        'process.env.NODE_ENV': `'production'`,
    },
    bundle: true,
    mainFields: ['module', 'main'],
    platform: 'neutral',
    sourcemap: false,
    sourcesContent: false,
    treeShaking: true,
    target: ['es2020'],
    minify: true,
    entryPoints: ['./resources/js/filament/rich-content-plugins/highlight.js'],
    outfile: './resources/js/dist/filament/rich-content-plugins/highlight.js',
})
```

As you can see at the bottom of the script, we are compiling a file called `resources/js/filament/rich-content-plugins/highlight.js` into `resources/js/dist/filament/rich-content-plugins/highlight.js`. You can change these paths to suit your needs. You can compile as many files as you want.

To run the script and compile this file into `resources/js/dist/filament/rich-content-plugins/highlight.js` run the following command:

```bash
node bin/build.js
```

You should register it in the `boot()` method of a service provider, like `AppServiceProvider`, and use `loadedOnRequest()` so that it is not downloaded until the rich editor is loaded on a page:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\Js;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::register([
    Js::make('rich-content-plugins/highlight', __DIR__ . '/../../resources/js/dist/filament/rich-content-plugins/highlight.js')->loadedOnRequest(),
]);
```

To publish this new JavaScript file into the `/public` directory of your app so that it can be served, you can use the `filament:assets` command:

```bash
php artisan filament:assets
```

In the [plugin object](#extending-the-rich-editor), the `getTipTapJsExtensions()` method should return the path to the JavaScript file you just created. Now that it's registered with `FilamentAsset`, you can use the `getScriptSrc()` method to get the URL to the file:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

/**
 * @return array<string>
 */
public function getTipTapJsExtensions(): array
{
    return [
        FilamentAsset::getScriptSrc('rich-content-plugins/highlight'),
    ];
}
```

## Introduction

The markdown editor allows you to edit and preview markdown content, as well as upload images using drag and drop.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;

MarkdownEditor::make('content')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/markdown-editor/simple" alt="Markdown editor" version="4.x" />

## Security

By default, the editor outputs raw Markdown and HTML, and sends it to the backend. Attackers are able to intercept the value of the component and send a different raw HTML string to the backend. As such, it is important that when outputting the HTML from a Markdown editor, it is sanitized; otherwise your site may be exposed to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

When Filament outputs raw HTML from the database in components such as `TextColumn` and `TextEntry`, it sanitizes it to remove any dangerous JavaScript. However, if you are outputting the HTML from a Markdown editor in your own Blade view, this is your responsibility. One option is to use Filament's `sanitizeHtml()` helper to do this, which is the same tool we use to sanitize HTML in the components mentioned above:

```blade
{!! str($record->content)->markdown()->sanitizeHtml() !!}
```

## Customizing the toolbar buttons

You may set the toolbar buttons for the editor using the `toolbarButtons()` method. The options shown here are the defaults:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;

MarkdownEditor::make('content')
    ->toolbarButtons([
        ['bold', 'italic', 'strike', 'link'],
        ['heading'],
        ['blockquote', 'codeBlock', 'bulletList', 'orderedList'],
        ['table', 'attachFiles'],
        ['undo', 'redo'],
    ])
```

Each nested array in the main array represents a group of buttons in the toolbar.

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `toolbarButtons()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Uploading images to the editor

You may customize how images are uploaded using configuration methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;

MarkdownEditor::make('content')
    ->fileAttachmentsDisk('s3')
    ->fileAttachmentsDirectory('attachments')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `fileAttachmentsDisk()` and `fileAttachmentsDirectory()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Introduction

The repeater component allows you to output a JSON array of repeated form components.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')->required(),
        Select::make('role')
            ->options([
                'member' => 'Member',
                'administrator' => 'Administrator',
                'owner' => 'Owner',
            ])
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->columns(2)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/simple" alt="Repeater" version="4.x" />

We recommend that you store repeater data with a `JSON` column in your database. Additionally, if you're using Eloquent, make sure that column has an `array` cast.

As evident in the above example, the component schema can be defined within the `schema()` method of the component:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')->required(),
        // ...
    ])
```

If you wish to define a repeater with multiple schema blocks that can be repeated in any order, please use the [builder](builder).

## Setting empty default items

Repeaters may have a certain number of empty items created by default. The default is only used when a schema is loaded with no data. In a standard [panel resource](../resources), defaults are used on the Create page, not the Edit page. To use default items, pass the number of items to the `defaultItems()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->defaultItems(3)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `defaultItems()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Adding items

An action button is displayed below the repeater to allow the user to add a new item.

## Setting the add action button's label

You may set a label to customize the text that should be displayed in the button for adding a repeater item, using the `addActionLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addActionLabel('Add member')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `addActionLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Aligning the add action button

By default, the add action is aligned in the center. You may adjust this using the `addActionAlignment()` method, passing an `Alignment` option of `Alignment::Start` or `Alignment::End`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addActionAlignment(Alignment::Start)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `addActionAlignment()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Preventing the user from adding items

You may prevent the user from adding items to the repeater using the `addable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addable(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `addable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Deleting items

An action button is displayed on each item to allow the user to delete it.

### Preventing the user from deleting items

You may prevent the user from deleting items from the repeater using the `deletable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->deletable(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `deletable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Reordering items

A button is displayed on each item to allow the user to drag and drop to reorder it in the list.

### Preventing the user from reordering items

You may prevent the user from reordering items from the repeater using the `reorderable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderable(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `reorderable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Reordering items with buttons

You may use the `reorderableWithButtons()` method to enable reordering items with buttons to move the item up and down:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderableWithButtons()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/reorderable-with-buttons" alt="Repeater that is reorderable with buttons" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the repeater should be ordered with buttons or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderableWithButtons(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `reorderableWithButtons()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Preventing reordering with drag and drop

You may use the `reorderableWithDragAndDrop(false)` method to prevent items from being ordered with drag and drop:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderableWithDragAndDrop(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `reorderableWithDragAndDrop()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Collapsing items

The repeater may be `collapsible()` to optionally hide content in long forms:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
```

You may also collapse all items by default:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsed()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/collapsed" alt="Collapsed repeater" version="4.x" />

Optionally, the `collapsible()` and `collapsed()` methods accept a boolean value to control if the repeater should be collapsible and collapsed or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible(FeatureFlag::active())
    ->collapsed(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `collapsible()` and `collapsed()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Cloning items

You may allow repeater items to be duplicated using the `cloneable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->cloneable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/cloneable" alt="Cloneable repeater" version="4.x" />

Optionally, the `cloneable()` method accepts a boolean value to control if the repeater should be cloneable or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->cloneable(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `cloneable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Integrating with an Eloquent relationship

You may employ the `relationship()` method of the `Repeater` to configure a `HasMany` relationship. Filament will load the item data from the relationship, and save it back to the relationship when the form is submitted. If a custom relationship name is not passed to `relationship()`, Filament will use the field name as the relationship name:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    When using `disabled()` with `relationship()`, ensure that `disabled()` is called before `relationship()`. This ensures that the `dehydrated()` call from within `relationship()` is not overridden by the call from `disabled()`:
    
    ```php
    use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
    
    Repeater::make('qualifications')
        ->disabled()
        ->relationship()
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ])
    ```
</Aside>

### Reordering items in a relationship

By default, [reordering](#reordering-items) relationship repeater items is disabled. This is because your related model needs a `sort` column to store the order of related records. To enable reordering, you may use the `orderColumn()` method, passing in a name of the column on your related model to store the order in:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->orderColumn('sort')
```

If you use something like [`spatie/eloquent-sortable`](https://github.com/spatie/eloquent-sortable) with an order column such as `order_column`, you may pass this in to `orderColumn()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->orderColumn('order_column')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `orderColumn()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Integrating with a `BelongsToMany` Eloquent relationship

There is a common misconception that using a `BelongsToMany` relationship with a repeater is as simple as using a `HasMany` relationship. This is not the case, as a `BelongsToMany` relationship requires a pivot table to store the relationship data. The repeater saves its data to the related model, not the pivot table. Therefore, if you want to map each repeater item to a row in the pivot table, you must use a `HasMany` relationship with a pivot model to use a repeater with a `BelongsToMany` relationship.

Imagine you have a form to create a new `Order` model. Each order belongs to many `Product` models, and each product belongs to many orders. You have a `order_product` pivot table to store the relationship data. Instead of using the `products` relationship with the repeater, you should create a new relationship called `orderProducts` on the `Order` model, and use that with the repeater:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany;

public function orderProducts(): HasMany
{
    return $this->hasMany(OrderProduct::class);
}
```

If you don't already have an `OrderProduct` pivot model, you should create that, with inverse relationships to `Order` and `Product`:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Pivot;

class OrderProduct extends Pivot
{
    public $incrementing = true;

    public function order(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Order::class);
    }

    public function product(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Product::class);
    }
}
```

<Aside variant="info">
    Please ensure that your pivot model has a primary key column, like `id`, to allow Filament to keep track of which repeater items have been created, updated and deleted. To make sure that Filament keeps track of the primary key, the pivot model needs to have the `$incrementing` property set to `true`.
</Aside>

Now you can use the `orderProducts` relationship with the repeater, and it will save the data to the `order_product` pivot table:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Repeater::make('orderProducts')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        Select::make('product_id')
            ->relationship('product', 'name')
            ->required(),
        // ...
    ])
```

### Mutating related item data before filling the field

You may mutate the data for a related item before it is filled into the field using the `mutateRelationshipDataBeforeFillUsing()` method. This method accepts a closure that receives the current item's data in a `$data` variable. You must return the modified array of data:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->mutateRelationshipDataBeforeFillUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Data;;array<array<string, mixed>>;;$data;;The data that is being filled into the repeater.">You can inject various utilities into the function passed to `mutateRelationshipDataBeforeFillUsing()` as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Mutating related item data before creating

You may mutate the data for a new related item before it is created in the database using the `mutateRelationshipDataBeforeCreateUsing()` method. This method accepts a closure that receives the current item's data in a `$data` variable. You can choose to return either the modified array of data, or `null` to prevent the item from being created:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->mutateRelationshipDataBeforeCreateUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Data;;array<string, mixed>;;$data;;The data that is being saved by the repeater.">You can inject various utilities into the function passed to `mutateRelationshipDataBeforeCreateUsing()` as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Mutating related item data before saving

You may mutate the data for an existing related item before it is saved in the database using the `mutateRelationshipDataBeforeSaveUsing()` method. This method accepts a closure that receives the current item's data in a `$data` variable. You can choose to return either the modified array of data, or `null` to prevent the item from being saved:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->mutateRelationshipDataBeforeSaveUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Data;;array<string, mixed>;;$data;;The data that is being saved by the repeater.">You can inject various utilities into the function passed to `mutateRelationshipDataBeforeSaveUsing()` as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Grid layout

You may organize repeater items into columns by using the `grid()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->grid(2)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/grid" alt="Repeater with a 2 column grid of items" version="4.x" />

This method accepts the same options as the `columns()` method of the [grid](../schemas/layouts#grid-system). This allows you to responsively customize the number of grid columns at various breakpoints.

## Adding a label to repeater items based on their content

You may add a label for repeater items using the `itemLabel()` method. This method accepts a closure that receives the current item's data in a `$state` variable. You must return a string to be used as the item label:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->required()
            ->live(onBlur: true),
        Select::make('role')
            ->options([
                'member' => 'Member',
                'administrator' => 'Administrator',
                'owner' => 'Owner',
            ])
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->columns(2)
    ->itemLabel(fn (array $state): ?string => $state['name'] ?? null),
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    Any fields that you use from `$state` should be `live()` if you wish to see the item label update live as you use the form.
</Aside>

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Item;;Filament\Schemas\Schema;;$item;;The schema object for the current repeater item.||Key;;string;;$key;;The key for the current repeater item.||State;;array<string, mixed>;;$state;;The raw unvalidated data for the current repeater item.">You can inject various utilities into the function passed to `itemLabel()` as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/labelled" alt="Repeater with item labels" version="4.x" />

## Simple repeaters with one field

You can use the `simple()` method to create a repeater with a single field, using a minimal design

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Repeater::make('invitations')
    ->simple(
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->email()
            ->required(),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `simple()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/simple-one-field" alt="Simple repeater design with only one field" version="4.x" />

Instead of using a nested array to store data, simple repeaters use a flat array of values. This means that the data structure for the above example could look like this:

```php
[
    'invitations' => [
        'dan@filamentphp.com',
        'ryan@filamentphp.com',
    ],
],
```

## Using `$get()` to access parent field values

All form components are able to [use `$get()` and `$set()`](overview#injecting-the-state-of-another-field) to access another field's value. However, you might experience unexpected behavior when using this inside the repeater's schema.

This is because `$get()` and `$set()`, by default, are scoped to the current repeater item. This means that you are able to interact with another field inside that repeater item easily without knowing which repeater item the current form component belongs to.

The consequence of this is that you may be confused when you are unable to interact with a field outside the repeater. We use `../` syntax to solve this problem - `$get('../parent_field_name')`.

Consider your form has this data structure:

```php
[
    'client_id' => 1,

    'repeater' => [
        'item1' => [
            'service_id' => 2,
        ],
    ],
]
```

You are trying to retrieve the value of `client_id` from inside the repeater item.

`$get()` is relative to the current repeater item, so `$get('client_id')` is looking for `$get('repeater.item1.client_id')`.

You can use `../` to go up a level in the data structure, so `$get('../client_id')` is `$get('repeater.client_id')` and `$get('../client_id')` is `$get('client_id')`.

The special case of `$get()` with no arguments, or `$get('')` or `$get('./')`, will always return the full data array for the current repeater item.

## Table repeaters

You can present repeater items in a table format using the `table()` method, which accepts an array of `TableColumn` objects. These objects represent the columns of the table, which correspond to any components in the schema of the repeater:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater\TableColumn;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->table([
        TableColumn::make('Name'),
        TableColumn::make('Role'),
    ])
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->required(),
        Select::make('role')
            ->options([
                'member' => 'Member',
                'administrator' => 'Administrator',
                'owner' => 'Owner',
            ])
            ->required(),
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/table" alt="Repeater with a table layout" version="4.x" />

The labels displayed in the header of the table are passed to the `TableColumn::make()` method. If you want to provide an accessible label for a column but do not wish to display it, you can use the `hiddenHeaderLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater\TableColumn;

TableColumn::make('Name')
    ->hiddenHeaderLabel()
```

If you would like to mark a column as "required" with a red asterisk, you can use the `markAsRequired()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater\TableColumn;

TableColumn::make('Name')
    ->markAsRequired()
```

You can enable wrapping of the column header using the `wrapHeader()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater\TableColumn;

TableColumn::make('Name')
    ->wrapHeader()
```

You can also adjust the alignment of the column header using the `alignment()` method, passing an `Alignment` option of `Alignment::Start`, `Alignment::Center`, or `Alignment::End`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater\TableColumn;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;

TableColumn::make('Name')
    ->alignment(Alignment::Start)
```

You can set a fixed column width using the `width()` method, passing a string value that represents the width of the column. This value is passed directly to the `style` attribute of the column header:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater\TableColumn;

TableColumn::make('Name')
    ->width('200px')
```

## Repeater validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to repeaters.

### Number of items validation

You can validate the minimum and maximum number of items that you can have in a repeater by setting the `minItems()` and `maxItems()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->minItems(2)
    ->maxItems(5)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `minItems()` and `maxItems()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Distinct state validation

In many cases, you will want to ensure some sort of uniqueness between repeater items. A couple of common examples could be:

- Ensuring that only one [checkbox](checkbox) or [toggle](toggle) is activated at once across items in the repeater.
- Ensuring that an option may only be selected once across [select](select), [radio](radio), [checkbox list](checkbox-list), or [toggle buttons](toggle-buttons) fields in a repeater.

You can use the `distinct()` method to validate that the state of a field is unique across all items in the repeater:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('answers')
    ->schema([
        // ...
        Checkbox::make('is_correct')
            ->distinct(),
    ])
```

The behavior of the `distinct()` validation depends on the data type that the field handles

- If the field returns a boolean, like a [checkbox](checkbox) or [toggle](toggle), the validation will ensure that only one item has a value of `true`. There may be many fields in the repeater that have a value of `false`.
- Otherwise, for fields like a [select](select), [radio](radio), [checkbox list](checkbox-list), or [toggle buttons](toggle-buttons), the validation will ensure that each option may only be selected once across all items in the repeater.

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to the `distinct()` method to control if the field should be distinct or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_correct')
    ->distinct(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `distinct()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Automatically fixing indistinct state

If you'd like to automatically fix indistinct state, you can use the `fixIndistinctState()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('answers')
    ->schema([
        // ...
        Checkbox::make('is_correct')
            ->fixIndistinctState(),
    ])
```

This method will automatically enable the `distinct()` and `live()` methods on the field.

Depending on the data type that the field handles, the behavior of the `fixIndistinctState()` adapts:

- If the field returns a boolean, like a [checkbox](checkbox) or [toggle](toggle), and one of the fields is enabled, Filament will automatically disable all other enabled fields on behalf of the user.
- Otherwise, for fields like a [select](select), [radio](radio), [checkbox list](checkbox-list), or [toggle buttons](toggle-buttons), when a user selects an option, Filament will automatically deselect all other usages of that option on behalf of the user.

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to the `fixIndistinctState()` method to control if the field should fix indistinct state or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_correct')
    ->fixIndistinctState(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `fixIndistinctState()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Disabling options when they are already selected in another item

If you'd like to disable options in a [select](select), [radio](radio), [checkbox list](checkbox-list), or [toggle buttons](toggle-buttons) when they are already selected in another item, you can use the `disableOptionsWhenSelectedInSiblingRepeaterItems()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        Select::make('role')
            ->options([
                // ...
            ])
            ->disableOptionsWhenSelectedInSiblingRepeaterItems(),
    ])
```

This method will automatically enable the `distinct()` and `live()` methods on the field.

<Aside variant="warning">
    In case you want to add another condition to [disable options](../select#disabling-specific-options) with, you can chain `disableOptionWhen()` with the `merge: true` argument:
    
    ```php
    use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
    use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
    
    Repeater::make('members')
        ->schema([
            Select::make('role')
                ->options([
                    // ...
                ])
                ->disableOptionsWhenSelectedInSiblingRepeaterItems()
                ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'super_admin', merge: true),
        ])
    ```
</Aside>

## Customizing the repeater item actions

This field uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the `$action` object, which you can use to [customize it](../actions/overview). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

- `addAction()`
- `cloneAction()`
- `collapseAction()`
- `collapseAllAction()`
- `deleteAction()`
- `expandAction()`
- `expandAllAction()`
- `moveDownAction()`
- `moveUpAction()`
- `reorderAction()`

Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapseAllAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Collapse all members'),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Action;;Filament\Actions\Action;;$action;;The action object to customize.">The action registration methods can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Confirming repeater actions with a modal

You can confirm actions with a modal by using the `requiresConfirmation()` method on the action object. You may use any [modal customization method](../actions/modals) to change its content and behavior:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->deleteAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->requiresConfirmation(),
    )
```

<Aside variant="info">
    The `collapseAction()`, `collapseAllAction()`, `expandAction()`, `expandAllAction()` and `reorderAction()` methods do not support confirmation modals, as clicking their buttons does not make the network request that is required to show the modal.
</Aside>

### Adding extra item actions to a repeater

You may add new [action buttons](../actions) to the header of each repeater item by passing `Action` objects into `extraItemActions()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->label('Email address')
            ->email(),
        // ...
    ])
    ->extraItemActions([
        Action::make('sendEmail')
            ->icon(Heroicon::Envelope)
            ->action(function (array $arguments, Repeater $component): void {
                $itemData = $component->getItemState($arguments['item']);

                Mail::to($itemData['email'])
                    ->send(
                        // ...
                    );
            }),
    ])
```

In this example, `$arguments['item']` gives you the ID of the current repeater item. You can validate the data in that repeater item using the `getItemState()` method on the repeater component. This method returns the validated data for the item. If the item is not valid, it will cancel the action and show an error message for that item in the form.

If you want to get the raw data from the current item without validating it, you can use `$component->getRawItemState($arguments['item'])` instead.

If you want to manipulate the raw data for the entire repeater, for example, to add, remove or modify items, you can use `$component->getState()` to get the data, and `$component->state($state)` to set it again:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

// Get the raw data for the entire repeater
$state = $component->getState();

// Add an item, with a random UUID as the key
$state[Str::uuid()] = [
    'email' => auth()->user()->email,
];

// Set the new data for the repeater
$component->state($state);
```

## Introduction

Similar to a [repeater](repeater), the builder component allows you to output a JSON array of repeated form components. Unlike the repeater, which only defines one form schema to repeat, the builder allows you to define different schema "blocks", which you can repeat in any order. This makes it useful for building more advanced array structures.

The primary use of the builder component is to build web page content using predefined blocks. This could be content for a marketing website, or maybe even fields in an online form. The example below defines multiple blocks for different elements in the page content. On the frontend of your website, you could loop through each block in the JSON and format it how you wish.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder\Block;
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        Block::make('heading')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('content')
                    ->label('Heading')
                    ->required(),
                Select::make('level')
                    ->options([
                        'h1' => 'Heading 1',
                        'h2' => 'Heading 2',
                        'h3' => 'Heading 3',
                        'h4' => 'Heading 4',
                        'h5' => 'Heading 5',
                        'h6' => 'Heading 6',
                    ])
                    ->required(),
            ])
            ->columns(2),
        Block::make('paragraph')
            ->schema([
                Textarea::make('content')
                    ->label('Paragraph')
                    ->required(),
            ]),
        Block::make('image')
            ->schema([
                FileUpload::make('url')
                    ->label('Image')
                    ->image()
                    ->required(),
                TextInput::make('alt')
                    ->label('Alt text')
                    ->required(),
            ]),
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/builder/simple" alt="Builder" version="4.x" />

We recommend that you store builder data with a `JSON` column in your database. Additionally, if you're using Eloquent, make sure that column has an `array` cast.

As evident in the above example, blocks can be defined within the `blocks()` method of the component. Blocks are `Builder\Block` objects, and require a unique name, and a component schema:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder\Block;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        Block::make('heading')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('content')->required(),
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

## Setting a block's label

By default, the label of the block will be automatically determined based on its name. To override the block's label, you may use the `label()` method. Customizing the label in this way is useful if you wish to use a [translation string for localization](https://laravel.com/docs/localization#retrieving-translation-strings):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder\Block;

Block::make('heading')
    ->label(__('blocks.heading'))
```

### Labelling builder items based on their content

You may add a label for a builder item using the same `label()` method. This method accepts a closure that receives the item's data in a `$state` variable. If `$state` is null, you should return the block label that should be displayed in the block picker. Otherwise, you should return a string to be used as the item label:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder\Block;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Block::make('heading')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('content')
            ->live(onBlur: true)
            ->required(),
        // ...
    ])
    ->label(function (?array $state): string {
        if ($state === null) {
            return 'Heading';
        }

        return $state['content'] ?? 'Untitled heading';
    })
```

Any fields that you use from `$state` should be `live()` if you wish to see the item label update live as you use the form.

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Key;;string;;$key;;The key for the current block.||State;;array<string, mixed>;;$state;;The raw unvalidated data for the current block.">You can inject various utilities into the function passed to `label()` as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/builder/labelled" alt="Builder with labelled blocks based on the content" version="4.x" />

### Numbering builder items

By default, items in the builder have a number next to their label. You may disable this using the `blockNumbers(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->blockNumbers(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `blockNumbers()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Setting a block's icon

Blocks may also have an [icon](../styling/icons), which is displayed next to the label. You can add an icon by passing its name to the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder\Block;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

Block::make('paragraph')
    ->icon(Heroicon::Bars3BottomLeft)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `icon()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/builder/icons" alt="Builder with block icons in the dropdown" version="4.x" />

### Adding icons to the header of blocks

By default, blocks in the builder don't have an icon next to the header label, just in the dropdown to add new blocks. You may enable this using the `blockIcons()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->blockIcons()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to the `blockIcons()` method to control if the icons are displayed in the block headers:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->blockIcons(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `blockIcons()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Previewing blocks

If you prefer to render read-only previews in the builder instead of the blocks' forms, you can use the `blockPreviews()` method. This will render each block's `preview()` instead of the form. Block data will be passed to the preview Blade view in a variable with the same name:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder\Block;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blockPreviews()
    ->blocks([
        Block::make('heading')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('text')
                    ->placeholder('Default heading'),
            ])
            ->preview('filament.content.block-previews.heading'),
    ])
```

In `/resources/views/filament/content/block-previews/heading.blade.php`, you can access the block data like so:

```blade
<h1>
    {{ $text ?? 'Default heading' }}
</h1>
```

Optionally, the `blockPreviews()` method accepts a boolean value to control if the builder should render block previews or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->blockPreviews(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `blockPreviews()` and `preview()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Interactive block previews

By default, preview content is not interactive, and clicking it will open the Edit modal for that block to manage its settings. If you have links and buttons that you'd like to remain interactive in the block previews, you can use the `areInteractive: true` argument of the `blockPreviews()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blockPreviews(areInteractive: true)
    ->blocks([
        //
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `areInteractive` argument also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Adding items

An action button is displayed below the builder to allow the user to add a new item.

## Setting the add action button's label

You may set a label to customize the text that should be displayed in the button for adding a builder item, using the `addActionLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addActionLabel('Add a new block')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `addActionLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Aligning the add action button

By default, the add action is aligned in the center. You may adjust this using the `addActionAlignment()` method, passing an `Alignment` option of `Alignment::Start` or `Alignment::End`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;

Builder::make('content')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addActionAlignment(Alignment::Start)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `addActionAlignment()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Preventing the user from adding items

You may prevent the user from adding items to the builder using the `addable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addable(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `addable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Deleting items

An action button is displayed on each item to allow the user to delete it.

### Preventing the user from deleting items

You may prevent the user from deleting items from the builder using the `deletable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->deletable(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `deletable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Reordering items

A button is displayed on each item to allow the user to drag and drop to reorder it in the list.

### Preventing the user from reordering items

You may prevent the user from reordering items from the builder using the `reorderable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderable(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `reorderable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Reordering items with buttons

You may use the `reorderableWithButtons()` method to enable reordering items with buttons to move the item up and down:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderableWithButtons()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/builder/reorderable-with-buttons" alt="Builder that is reorderable with buttons" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the builder should be ordered with buttons or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderableWithButtons(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `reorderableWithButtons()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Preventing reordering with drag and drop

You may use the `reorderableWithDragAndDrop(false)` method to prevent items from being ordered with drag and drop:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderableWithDragAndDrop(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `reorderableWithDragAndDrop()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Collapsing items

The builder may be `collapsible()` to optionally hide content in long forms:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
```

You may also collapse all items by default:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsed()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/builder/collapsed" alt="Collapsed builder" version="4.x" />

Optionally, the `collapsible()` and `collapsed()` methods accept a boolean value to control if the builder should be collapsible and collapsed or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible(FeatureFlag::active())
    ->collapsed(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `collapsible()` and `collapsed()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Cloning items

You may allow builder items to be duplicated using the `cloneable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->cloneable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/builder/cloneable" alt="Cloneable repeater" version="4.x" />

## Customizing the block picker

### Changing the number of columns in the block picker

The block picker has only 1 column. You may customize it by passing a number of columns to `blockPickerColumns()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make()
    ->blockPickerColumns(2)
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
```

This method can be used in a couple of different ways:

- You can pass an integer like `blockPickerColumns(2)`. This integer is the number of columns used on the `lg` breakpoint and higher. All smaller devices will have just 1 column.
- You can pass an array, where the key is the breakpoint and the value is the number of columns. For example, `blockPickerColumns(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will create a 2 column layout on medium devices, and a 4 column layout on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.

Breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`) are defined by Tailwind, and can be found in the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview).

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `blockPickerColumns()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Increasing the width of the block picker

When you [increase the number of columns](#changing-the-number-of-columns-in-the-block-picker), the width of the dropdown should increase incrementally to handle the additional columns. If you'd like more control, you can manually set a maximum width for the dropdown using the `blockPickerWidth()` method. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, `5xl`, `6xl`, `7xl`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make()
    ->blockPickerColumns(3)
    ->blockPickerWidth('2xl')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `blockPickerWidth()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Limiting the number of times a block can be used

By default, each block can be used in the builder an unlimited number of times. You may limit this using the `maxItems()` method on a block:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder\Block;

Block::make('heading')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->maxItems(1)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `maxItems()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Using `$get()` to access parent field values

All form components are able to [use `$get()` and `$set()`](overview#injecting-the-state-of-another-field) to access another field's value. However, you might experience unexpected behavior when using this inside the builder's schema.

This is because `$get()` and `$set()`, by default, are scoped to the current builder item. This means that you are able to interact with another field inside that builder item easily without knowing which builder item the current form component belongs to.

The consequence of this is that you may be confused when you are unable to interact with a field outside the builder. We use `../` syntax to solve this problem - `$get('../parent_field_name')`.

Consider your form has this data structure:

```php
[
    'client_id' => 1,

    'builder' => [
        'item1' => [
            'service_id' => 2,
        ],
    ],
]
```

You are trying to retrieve the value of `client_id` from inside the builder item.

`$get()` is relative to the current builder item, so `$get('client_id')` is looking for `$get('builder.item1.client_id')`.

You can use `../` to go up a level in the data structure, so `$get('../client_id')` is `$get('builder.client_id')` and `$get('../client_id')` is `$get('client_id')`.

The special case of `$get()` with no arguments, or `$get('')` or `$get('./')`, will always return the full data array for the current builder item.

## Builder validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to builders.

### Number of items validation

You can validate the minimum and maximum number of items that you can have in a builder by setting the `minItems()` and `maxItems()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->minItems(1)
    ->maxItems(5)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `minItems()` and `maxItems()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the builder item actions

This field uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the `$action` object, which you can use to [customize it](../actions/overview). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

- `addAction()`
- `addBetweenAction()`
- `cloneAction()`
- `collapseAction()`
- `collapseAllAction()`
- `deleteAction()`
- `expandAction()`
- `expandAllAction()`
- `moveDownAction()`
- `moveUpAction()`
- `reorderAction()`

Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapseAllAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Collapse all content'),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Action;;Filament\Actions\Action;;$action;;The action object to customize.">The action registration methods can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Confirming builder actions with a modal

You can confirm actions with a modal by using the `requiresConfirmation()` method on the action object. You may use any [modal customization method](../actions/modals) to change its content and behavior:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->deleteAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->requiresConfirmation(),
    )
```

<Aside variant="info">
    The `addAction()`, `addBetweenAction()`, `collapseAction()`, `collapseAllAction()`, `expandAction()`, `expandAllAction()` and `reorderAction()` methods do not support confirmation modals, as clicking their buttons does not make the network request that is required to show the modal.
</Aside>

### Adding extra item actions to a builder

You may add new [action buttons](../actions) to the header of each builder item by passing `Action` objects into `extraItemActions()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder\Block;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        Block::make('contactDetails')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('email')
                    ->label('Email address')
                    ->email()
                    ->required(),
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
    ->extraItemActions([
        Action::make('sendEmail')
            ->icon(Heroicon::Square2Stack)
            ->action(function (array $arguments, Builder $component): void {
                $itemData = $component->getItemState($arguments['item']);
                
                Mail::to($itemData['email'])
                    ->send(
                        // ...
                    );
            }),
    ])
```

In this example, `$arguments['item']` gives you the ID of the current builder item. You can validate the data in that builder item using the `getItemState()` method on the builder component. This method returns the validated data for the item. If the item is not valid, it will cancel the action and show an error message for that item in the form.

If you want to get the raw data from the current item without validating it, you can use `$component->getRawItemState($arguments['item'])` instead.

If you want to manipulate the raw data for the entire builder, for example, to add, remove or modify items, you can use `$component->getState()` to get the data, and `$component->state($state)` to set it again:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

// Get the raw data for the entire builder
$state = $component->getState();

// Add an item, with a random UUID as the key
$state[Str::uuid()] = [
    'type' => 'contactDetails',
    'data' => [
        'email' => auth()->user()->email,
    ],
];

// Set the new data for the builder
$component->state($state);
```

title: Tags input
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

The tags input component allows you to interact with a list of tags.

By default, tags are stored in JSON:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/tags-input/simple" alt="Tags input" version="4.x" />

If you're saving the JSON tags using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'tags' => 'array',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    Filament also supports [`spatie/laravel-tags`](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-tags). See our [plugin documentation](/plugins/filament-spatie-tags) for more information.
</Aside>

## Comma-separated tags

You may allow the tags to be stored in a separated string, instead of JSON. To set this up, pass the separating character to the `separator()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->separator(',')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `separator()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Autocompleting tag suggestions

Tags inputs may have autocomplete suggestions. To enable this, pass an array of suggestions to the `suggestions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->suggestions([
        'tailwindcss',
        'alpinejs',
        'laravel',
        'livewire',
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static array, the `suggestions()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Defining split keys

Split keys allow you to map specific buttons on your user's keyboard to create a new tag. By default, when the user presses "Enter", a new tag is created in the input. You may also define other keys to create new tags, such as "Tab" or " ". To do this, pass an array of keys to the `splitKeys()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->splitKeys(['Tab', ' '])
```

You can [read more about possible options for keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key).

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static array, the `splitKeys()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Adding a prefix and suffix to individual tags

You can add prefix and suffix to tags without modifying the real state of the field. This can be useful if you need to show presentational formatting to users without saving it. This is done with the `tagPrefix()` or `tagSuffix()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('percentages')
    ->tagSuffix('%')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `tagPrefix()` and `tagSuffix()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Reordering tags

You can allow the user to reorder tags within the field using the `reorderable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->reorderable()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the tags should be reorderable or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->reorderable(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `reorderable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Changing the color of tags

You can change the color of the tags by passing a [color](../styling/colors) to the `color()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->color('danger')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `color()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Trimming whitespace

You can automatically trim whitespace from the beginning and end of each tag using the `trim()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->trim()
```

You may want to enable trimming globally for all tags inputs, similar to Laravel's `TrimStrings` middleware. You can do this in a service provider using the `configureUsing()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::configureUsing(function (TagsInput $component): void {
    $component->trim();
});
```

## Tags validation

You may add validation rules for each tag by passing an array of rules to the `nestedRecursiveRules()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->nestedRecursiveRules([
        'min:3',
        'max:255',
    ])
```

title: Textarea
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

The textarea allows you to interact with a multi-line string:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('description')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/textarea/simple" alt="Textarea" version="4.x" />

## Resizing the textarea

You may change the size of the textarea by defining the `rows()` and `cols()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('description')
    ->rows(10)
    ->cols(20)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `rows()` and `cols()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Autosizing the textarea

You may allow the textarea to automatically resize to fit its content by setting the `autosize()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('description')
    ->autosize()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the textarea should be autosizeable or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('description')
    ->autosize(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `autosize()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Making the field read-only

Not to be confused with [disabling the field](overview#disabling-a-field), you may make the field "read-only" using the `readOnly()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('description')
    ->readOnly()
```

There are a few differences, compared to [`disabled()`](overview#disabling-a-field):

- When using `readOnly()`, the field will still be sent to the server when the form is submitted. It can be mutated with the browser console, or via JavaScript. You can use [`dehydrated(false)`](overview#preventing-a-field-from-being-dehydrated) to prevent this.
- There are no styling changes, such as less opacity, when using `readOnly()`.
- The field is still focusable when using `readOnly()`.

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the field should be read-only or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('description')
    ->readOnly(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `readOnly()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Disabling Grammarly checks

If the user has Grammarly installed and you would like to prevent it from analyzing the contents of the textarea, you can use the `disableGrammarly()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('description')
    ->disableGrammarly()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the field should disable Grammarly checks or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('description')
    ->disableGrammarly(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `disableGrammarly()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Trimming whitespace

You can automatically trim whitespace from the beginning and end of the textarea value using the `trim()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('description')
    ->trim()
```

You may want to enable trimming globally for all textareas, similar to Laravel's `TrimStrings` middleware. You can do this in a service provider using the `configureUsing()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::configureUsing(function (Textarea $component): void {
    $component->trim();
});
```

## Textarea validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to textareas.

### Length validation

You may limit the length of the textarea by setting the `minLength()` and `maxLength()` methods. These methods add both frontend and backend validation:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('description')
    ->minLength(2)
    ->maxLength(1024)
```

You can also specify the exact length of the textarea by setting the `length()`. This method adds both frontend and backend validation:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('question')
    ->length(100)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `minLength()`, `maxLength()` and `length()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

The key-value field allows you to interact with one-dimensional JSON object:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/key-value/simple" alt="Key-value" version="4.x" />

If you're saving the data in Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    { 
        return [
            'meta' => 'array',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Adding rows

An action button is displayed below the field to allow the user to add a new row.

## Setting the add action button's label

You may set a label to customize the text that should be displayed in the button for adding a row, using the `addActionLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')

## Customizing the key-value action objects

This field uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the `$action` object, which you can use to [customize it](../actions/overview). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

- `addAction()`
- `deleteAction()`
- `reorderAction()`

Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

KeyValue::make('meta')
    ->deleteAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->icon(Heroicon::XMark),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Action;;Filament\Actions\Action;;$action;;The action object to customize.">The action registration methods can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

title: Color picker
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Introduction

The color picker component allows you to pick a color in a range of formats.

By default, the component uses HEX format:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ColorPicker;

ColorPicker::make('color')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/color-picker/simple" alt="Color picker" version="4.x" />

## Setting the color format

While HEX format is used by default, you can choose which color format to use:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ColorPicker;

ColorPicker::make('hsl_color')
    ->hsl()

ColorPicker::make('rgb_color')
    ->rgb()

ColorPicker::make('rgba_color')
    ->rgba()
```

## Color picker validation

You may use Laravel's validation rules to validate the values of the color picker:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ColorPicker;

ColorPicker::make('hex_color')
    ->regex('/^#([a-fA-F0-9]{6}|[a-fA-F0-9]{3})\b$/')

ColorPicker::make('hsl_color')
    ->hsl()
    ->regex('/^hsl\(\s*(\d+)\s*,\s*(\d*(?:\.\d+)?%)\s*,\s*(\d*(?:\.\d+)?%)\)$/')

ColorPicker::make('rgb_color')
    ->rgb()
    ->regex('/^rgb\((\d{1,3}),\s*(\d{1,3}),\s*(\d{1,3})\)$/')

ColorPicker::make('rgba_color')
    ->rgba()
    ->regex('/^rgba\((\d{1,3}),\s*(\d{1,3}),\s*(\d{1,3}),\s*(\d*(?:\.\d+)?)\)$/')
```

---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

The toggle buttons input provides a group of buttons for selecting a single value, or multiple values, from a list of predefined options:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published'
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static array, the `options()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/simple" alt="Toggle buttons" version="4.x" />

## Changing the color of option buttons

You can change the [color](../styling/colors) of the option buttons using the `colors()` method. Each key in the array should correspond to an option value:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published'
    ])
    ->colors([
        'draft' => 'info',
        'scheduled' => 'warning',
        'published' => 'success',
    ])
```

If you are using an enum for the options, you can use the [`HasColor` interface](../advanced/enums#enum-colors) to define colors instead.

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static array, the `colors()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/colors" alt="Toggle buttons with different colors" version="4.x" />

## Adding icons to option buttons

You can add [icon](../styling/icons) to the option buttons using the `icons()` method. Each key in the array should correspond to an option value, and the value may be any valid [icon](../styling/icons):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published'
    ])
    ->icons([
        'draft' => Heroicon::OutlinedPencil,
        'scheduled' => Heroicon::OutlinedClock,
        'published' => Heroicon::OutlinedCheckCircle,
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static array, the `icons()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

If you are using an enum for the options, you can use the [`HasIcon` interface](../advanced/enums#enum-icons) to define icons instead.

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/icons" alt="Toggle buttons with icons" version="4.x" />

If you want to display only icons, you can use `hiddenButtonLabels()` to hide the option labels.

## Boolean options

If you want a simple boolean toggle button group, with "Yes" and "No" options, you can use the `boolean()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
```

The options will have [colors](#changing-the-color-of-option-buttons) and [icons](#adding-icons-to-option-buttons) set up automatically, but you can override these with `colors()` or `icons()`.

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/boolean" alt="Boolean toggle buttons" version="4.x" />

To customize the "Yes" label, you can use the `trueLabel` argument on the `boolean()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean(trueLabel: 'Absolutely!')
```

To customize the "No" label, you can use the `falseLabel` argument on the `boolean()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean(falseLabel: 'Not at all!')
```

## Positioning the options inline with each other

You may wish to display the buttons `inline()` with each other:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->inline()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/inline" alt="Inline toggle buttons" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the buttons should be inline or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->inline(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `inline()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Grouping option buttons

You may wish to group option buttons together so they are more compact, using the `grouped()` method. This also makes them appear horizontally inline with each other:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->grouped()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/grouped" alt="Grouped toggle buttons" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the buttons should be grouped or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->grouped(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `grouped()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Selecting multiple buttons

The `multiple()` method on the `ToggleButtons` component allows you to select multiple values from the list of options:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('technologies')
    ->multiple()
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/multiple" alt="Multiple toggle buttons selected" version="4.x" />

These options are returned in JSON format. If you're saving them using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class App extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    { 
        return [
            'technologies' => 'array',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the buttons should allow multiple selections or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('technologies')
    ->multiple(FeatureFlag::active())
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `multiple()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Splitting options into columns

You may split options into columns by using the `columns()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `columns()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/columns" alt="Toggle buttons with 2 columns" version="4.x" />

This method accepts the same options as the `columns()` method of the [grid](../schemas/layouts#grid-system). This allows you to responsively customize the number of columns at various breakpoints.

### Setting the grid direction

By default, when you arrange buttons into columns, they will be listed in order vertically. If you'd like to list them horizontally, you may use the `gridDirection(GridDirection::Row)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;
use Filament\Support\Enums\GridDirection;

ToggleButtons::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2)
    ->gridDirection(GridDirection::Row)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `gridDirection()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/rows" alt="Toggle buttons with 2 rows" version="4.x" />

## Disabling specific options

You can disable specific options using the `disableOptionWhen()` method. It accepts a closure, in which you can check if the option with a specific `$value` should be disabled:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'published')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Option value;;mixed;;$value;;The value of the option to disable.||Option label;;string | Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable;;$label;;The label of the option to disable.">You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/disabled-option" alt="Toggle buttons with disabled option" version="4.x" />

If you want to retrieve the options that have not been disabled, e.g. for validation purposes, you can do so using `getEnabledOptions()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'published')
    ->in(fn (ToggleButtons $component): array => array_keys($component->getEnabledOptions()))
```

For more information about the `in()` function, please see the [Validation documentation](validation#in).

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

The slider component allows you to drag a handle across a track to select one or more numeric values:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/simple" alt="Slider" version="4.x" />

The [noUiSlider](https://refreshless.com/nouislider) package is used for this component, and much of its API is based upon that library.

<Aside variant="warning">
    Due to their nature, slider fields can never be empty. The value of the field can never be `null` or an empty array. If a slider field is empty, the user will not have a handle to drag across the track.

    Because of this, slider fields have a default value set out of the box, which is set to the minimum value allowed in the [range](#controlling-the-range-of-the-slider) of the slider. The default value is used when a form is empty, for example on the Create page of a resource. To learn more about default values, check out the [`default()` documentation](overview#setting-the-default-value-of-a-field).
</Aside>

## Controlling the range of the slider

The minimum and maximum values that can be selected by the slider are 0 and 100 by default. Filament will automatically apply validation rules to ensure that users cannot exceed these values. You can adjust these with the `range()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 40, maxValue: 80)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `range()` method also accepts functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/range" alt="Slider with a customized range" version="4.x" />

### Controlling the step size

By default, users can select any decimal value between the minimum and maximum. You can restrict the values to a specific step size using the `step()` method. Filament will automatically apply validation rules to ensure that users cannot deviate from this step size:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->step(10)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `step()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Limiting the number of decimal places

If you would rather allow the user to select any decimal value between the minimum and maximum instead of restricting them to a certain step size, you can define a number of decimal places that their selected values will be rounded to using the `decimalPlaces()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->decimalPlaces(2)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `decimalPlaces()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Controlling the behavioral padding of the track

By default, users can select any value across the entire length of the track. You can add behavioral padding to the track using the `rangePadding()` method. This will ensure that the selected value is always at least a certain distance from the edges of the track. The minimum and maximum value validation that Filament applies to the slider by default will take the padding into account to ensure that users cannot exceed the padded range:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->rangePadding(10)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `rangePadding()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

In this example, even though the minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 100, the user will only be able to select values between 10 and 90. The padding will be applied to both ends of the track, so the selected value will always be at least 10 units away from the edges of the track.

If you would like to control the padding on each side of the track separately, you can pass an array of two values to the `rangePadding()` method. The first value will be applied to the start of the track, and the second value will be applied to the end of the track:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->rangePadding([10, 20])
```

### Right-to-left tracks

By default, a track operates left-to-right. If the user is using a right-to-left locale (e.g. Arabic), the track will be displayed right-to-left automatically. You can also force the track to be displayed right-to-left using the `rtl()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->rtl()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the slider should be right-to-left or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->rtl(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `rtl()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Adding multiple values to a slider

If the slider is set to an array of values, the user will be able to drag multiple handles across the track within the allowed range. Make sure that the slider has a [`default()` value](overview#setting-the-default-value-of-a-field) set to an array of values to use when a form is empty:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->default([20, 70])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/multiple" alt="Slider with multiple values" version="4.x" />

If you're saving multiple slider values using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'slider' => 'array',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Using a vertical track

You can display the slider as a vertical track instead of horizontal, you can use the `vertical()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->vertical()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/vertical" alt="Vertical slider" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the slider should be vertical or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->vertical(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `vertical()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Top-to-bottom tracks

By default, a vertical track operates bottom-to-top. In [noUiSlider](https://refreshless.com/nouislider), this is the [right-to-left behavior](#right-to-left-tracks). To assign the minimum value to the top of the track, you can use the `rtl(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->vertical()
    ->rtl(false)
```

## Adding tooltips to handles

You can add tooltips to the handles of the slider using the `tooltips()` method. The tooltip will display the current value of the handle:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->tooltips()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/tooltips" alt="Slider with tooltips" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the slider should have tooltips or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->tooltips(FeatureFlag::active())
```

When using multiple handles, multiple tooltips will be displayed, one for each handle. Tooltips also work with [vertical tracks](#using-a-vertical-track).

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/tooltips-vertical" alt="Vertical slider with tooltips" version="4.x" />

### Custom tooltip formatting

You can use JavaScript to customize the formatting of a tooltip. Pass a `RawJs` object to the `tooltips()` method, containing a JavaScript string expression to use. The current value to format will be available in the `$value` variable:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;
use Filament\Support\RawJs;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->tooltips(RawJs::make(<<<'JS'
        `$${$value.toFixed(2)}`
        JS))
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/tooltips-formatting" alt="Slider with custom tooltip formatting" version="4.x" />

### Controlling tooltips for multiple handles individually

If the slider is set to an array of values, you can control the tooltips for each handle separately by passing an array of values to the `tooltips()` method. The first value will be applied to the first handle, and the second value will be applied to the second handle, and so on:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->tooltips([true, false])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/tooltips-multiple" alt="Slider with multiple tooltips" version="4.x" />

## Filling a track with color

By default, the color of the track is not affected by the position of any handles it has. When using an individual handle, you can fill the part of the track before the handle with color using the `fillTrack()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->fillTrack()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/fill" alt="Slider with fill" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the slider should be filled or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->fillTrack(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `fillTrack()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

When using multiple handles, you must manually specify which parts of the track should be filled by passing an array of `true` and `false` values, one for each section. The total number of values should be one more than the number of handles. The first value will be applied to the section before the first handle, the second value will be applied to the section between the first and second handles, and so on:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->fillTrack([false, true, false])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/fill-multiple" alt="Slider with multiple fills" version="4.x" />

Filling also works on [vertical tracks](#using-a-vertical-track):

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/fill-vertical" alt="Vertical slider with fill" version="4.x" />

## Adding pips to tracks

You can add pips to tracks, which are small markers that indicate the position of the handles. You can add pips to the track using the `pips()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->pips()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/pips" alt="Slider with pips" version="4.x" />

Pips also work when there are multiple handles:

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/pips-multiple" alt="Slider with multiple pips" version="4.x" />

You can also add pips to [vertical tracks](#using-a-vertical-track):

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/pips-vertical" alt="Vertical slider with pips" version="4.x" />

### Adjusting the density of pips

By default, pips are displayed at a density of `10`. This means that for every 10 units of the track, a pip will be displayed. You can adjust this density using the `density` parameter of the `pips()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->pips(density: 5)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `density` parameter also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/pips-density" alt="Slider with a custom pips density" version="4.x" />

### Custom pip label formatting

You can use JavaScript to customize the formatting of a pip label. Pass a `RawJs` object to the `pipsFormatter()` method, containing a JavaScript string expression to use. The current value to format will be available in the `$value` variable:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;
use Filament\Support\RawJs;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->pips()
    ->pipsFormatter(RawJs::make(<<<'JS'
        `$${$value.toFixed(2)}`
        JS))
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `pipsFormatter()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/pips-formatting" alt="Slider with custom pips formatting" version="4.x" />

### Adding pip labels to steps of the track

If you are using [steps](#controlling-the-step-size) to restrict the movement of the track, you can add a pip label to each step. To do this, pass a `PipsMode::Steps` object to the `pips()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider\Enums\PipsMode;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->step(10)
    ->pips(PipsMode::Steps)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/pips-steps" alt="Slider with pips on steps" version="4.x" />

If you would like to add additional pips to the track without labels, you can [adjust the density](#adjusting-the-density-of-pips) of the pips as well:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider\Enums\PipsMode;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->step(10)
    ->pips(PipsMode::Steps, density: 5)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/pips-steps-density" alt="Slider with pips on steps and a custom density" version="4.x" />

### Adding pip labels to percentage positions of the track

If you would like to add pip labels to the track at specific percentage positions, you can pass a `PipsMode::Positions` object to the `pips()` method. The percentage positions need to be defined in the `pipsValues()` method in an array of numbers:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider\Enums\PipsMode;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->pips(PipsMode::Positions)
    ->pipsValues([0, 25, 50, 75, 100])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `pipsValues()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/pips-positions" alt="Slider with pips on positions" version="4.x" />

The [density](#adjusting-the-density-of-pips) still controls the spacing of the pips without labels.

### Adding a set number of pip labels to the track

If you would like to add a set number of pip labels to the track, you can pass a `PipsMode::Count` object to the `pips()` method. The number of pips need to be defined in the `pipsValues()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider\Enums\PipsMode;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->pips(PipsMode::Count)
    ->pipsValues(5)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `pipsValues()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/pips-count" alt="Slider with a set number of pips" version="4.x" />

The [density](#adjusting-the-density-of-pips) still controls the spacing of the pips without labels.

### Adding pip labels to set values on the track

Instead of defining [percentage positions](#adding-pip-labels-to-percentage-positions-of-the-track) or a [set number](#adding-a-set-number-of-pip-labels-to-the-track) of pip labels, you can also define a set of values to use for the pip labels. To do this, pass a `PipsMode::Values` object to the `pips()` method. The values need to be defined in the `pipsValues()` method in an array of numbers:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider\Enums\PipsMode;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->pips(PipsMode::Values)
    ->pipsValues([5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `pipsValues()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/pips-values" alt="Slider with pips on values" version="4.x" />

The [density](#adjusting-the-density-of-pips) still controls the spacing of the pips without labels:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider\Enums\PipsMode;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->pips(PipsMode::Values, density: 5)
    ->pipsValues([5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/pips-values-density" alt="Slider with pips on values and a custom density" version="4.x" />

### Manually filtering pips

For even more control over how pips are displayed on a track, you can use a JavaScript expression. The JavaScript expression should return different numbers based on the pip's appearance:

- The expression should return `1` if a large pip label should be displayed.
- The expression should return `2` if a small pip label should be displayed.
- The expression should return `0` if a pip should be displayed without a label.
- The expression should return `-1` if a pip should not be displayed at all.

The [density](#adjusting-the-density-of-pips) of the pips will control which values get passed to the JavaScript expression. The expression should use the `$value` variable to access the current value of the pip. The expression should be defined in a `RawJs` object and passed to the `pipsFilter()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;
use Filament\Support\RawJs;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->pips(density: 5)
    ->pipsFilter(RawJs::make(<<<'JS'
        ($value % 50) === 0
            ? 1
            : ($value % 10) === 0
                ? 2
                : ($value % 25) === 0
                    ? 0
                    : -1
        JS))
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `pipsFilter()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

In this example the `%` operator is used to determine the divisibility of the pip value. The expression will return `1` for every 50 units, `2` for every 10 units, `0` for every 25 units, and `-1` for all other values:

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/slider/pips-filter" alt="Slider with pips filter" version="4.x" />

## Setting a minimum difference between handles

To set a minimum distance between handles, you can use the `minDifference()` method, passing a number to it. This represents the real difference between the values of both handles, not their visual distance:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->minDifference(10)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `minDifference()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="warning">
    The `minDifference()` method does not impact the validation of the slider. A skilled user could manipulate the value of the slider using JavaScript to select a value that does not align with the minimum difference. They will still be prevented from selecting a value outside the range of the slider.
</Aside>

## Setting a maximum difference between handles

To set a maximum distance between handles, you can use the `maxDifference()` method, passing a number to it. This represents the real difference between the values of both handles, not their visual distance:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->maxDifference(40)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `maxDifference()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="warning">
    The `maxDifference()` method does not impact the validation of the slider. A skilled user could manipulate the value of the slider using JavaScript to select a value that does not align with the maximum difference. They will still be prevented from selecting a value outside the range of the slider.
</Aside>

## Controlling the general behavior of the slider

The `behavior()` method of the slider allows you to pass one or more `Behavior` objects to control the behavior of the slider. The available options are:

- `Behavior::Tap` - The slider will smoothly move to the position of the tap when the user clicks on the track. This is a default behavior, so when applying another behavior, you should also include this one in the array if you want to preserve it.
- `Behavior::Drag` - When there are two handles on the track, the user can drag the track to move both handles at the same time. The [`fillTrack([false, true, false])`](#filling-a-track-with-color) method must be used to ensure that the user has something to drag.
- `Behavior::Drag` and `Behavior::Fixed` - When there are two handles on the track, the user can drag the track to move both handles at the same time, but they cannot change the distance between them. The [`fillTrack([false, true, false])`](#filling-a-track-with-color) method must be used to ensure that the user has something to drag. Be aware that the distance between the handles is not automatically validated on the backend, so a skilled user could manipulate the value of the slider using JavaScript to select a value with a different distance. They will still be prevented from selecting a value outside the range of the slider.
- `Behavior::Unconstrained` - When there are multiple handles on the track, they can be dragged past each other. The [`minDifference()`](#setting-a-minimum-difference-between-handles) and [`maxDifference()`](#setting-a-maximum-difference-between-handles) methods will not work with this behavior.
- `Behavior::SmoothSteps` - While dragging handles, they will not snap to the [steps](#controlling-the-step-size) of the track. Once the user releases the handle, it will snap to the nearest step.

For example, to use `Behavior::Tap`, `Behavior::Drag` and `Behavior::SmoothSteps` all at once:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider\Enums\Behavior;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->behavior([Behavior::Tap, Behavior::Drag, Behavior::SmoothSteps])
```

To disable all behavior, including the default `Behavior::Tap`, you can use the `behavior(null)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->behavior(null)
```

## Non-linear tracks

You can create non-linear tracks, where certain parts of the track are compressed or expanded, by defining an array of percentage points in the `nonLinearPoints()` method of the slider. Each percentage key of the array should have a corresponding real value, which will be used to calculate the position of the handle on the track. The example below features [pips](#adding-pips-to-tracks) to demonstrate the non-linear behavior of the track:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->nonLinearPoints(['20%' => 50, '50%' => 75])
    ->pips()
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `nonLinearPoints()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

When using a non-linear track, you can also control the stepping for each section. By defining an array of two numbers for each percentage point, the first number will be used as the real value for percentage position, and the second number will be used as the step size for that section, active until the next percentage point:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 100)
    ->nonLinearPoints(['20%' => [50, 5], '50%' => [75, 1]])
    ->pips()
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    When using a non-linear track, the step values of certain track sections do not affect the validation of the slider. A skilled user could manipulate the value of the slider using JavaScript to select a value that does not align with a step value in the track. They will still be prevented from selecting a value outside the range of the slider.
</Aside>

When using [pips](#adding-pips-to-tracks) with a non-linear track, you can ensure that pip labels are rounded and only displayed at selectable positions on the track. Otherwise, the stepping of a non-linear portion of the track could add labels to positions that are not selectable. To do this, use the `steppedPips()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Slider\Enums\PipsMode;

Slider::make('slider')
    ->range(minValue: 0, maxValue: 10000)
    ->nonLinearPoints(['10%' => [500, 500], '50%' => [4000, 1000]])
    ->pips(PipsMode::Positions, density: 4)
    ->pipsValues([0, 25, 50, 75, 100])
    ->steppedPips()
```

## Introduction

The code editor component allows you to write code in a textarea with line numbers. By default, no syntax highlighting is applied.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CodeEditor;

CodeEditor::make('code')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/code-editor/simple" alt="Code editor" version="4.x" />

## Using language syntax highlighting

You may change the language syntax highlighting of the code editor using the `language()` method. The editor supports the following languages:

- C++
- CSS
- Go
- HTML
- Java
- JavaScript
- JSON
- Markdown
- PHP
- Python
- XML
- YAML

You can open the `Filament\Forms\Components\CodeEditor\Enums\Language` enum class to see this list. To switch to using JavaScript syntax highlighting, you can use the `Language::JavaScript` enum value:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CodeEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\CodeEditor\Enums\Language;

CodeEditor::make('code')
    ->language(Language::JavaScript)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `language()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Introduction

Livewire components are PHP classes that have their state stored in the user's browser. When a network request is made, the state is sent to the server, and filled into public properties on the Livewire component class, where it can be accessed in the same way as any other class property in PHP can be.

Imagine you had a Livewire component with a public property called `$name`. You could bind that property to an input field in the HTML of the Livewire component in one of two ways: with the [`wire:model` attribute](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/properties#data-binding), or by [entangling](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/javascript#the-wire-object) it with an Alpine.js property:

```blade
<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getFieldWrapperView()"
    :field="$field"
>
    <input wire:model="name" />
    
    <!-- Or -->
    
    <div x-data="{ state: $wire.$entangle('name') }">
        <input x-model="state" />
    </div>
</x-dynamic-component>
```

When the user types into the input field, the `$name` property is updated in the Livewire component class. When the user submits the form, the `$name` property is sent to the server, where it can be saved.

This is the basis of how fields work in Filament. Each field is assigned to a public property in the Livewire component class, which is where the state of the field is stored. We call the name of this property the "state path" of the field. You can access the state path of a field using the `$getStatePath()` function in the field's view:

```blade
<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getFieldWrapperView()"
    :field="$field"
>
    <input wire:model="{{ $getStatePath() }}" />

    <!-- Or -->
    
    <div x-data="{ state: $wire.$entangle('{{ $getStatePath() }}') }">
        <input x-model="state" />
    </div>
</x-dynamic-component>
```

If your component heavily relies on third party libraries, we advise that you asynchronously load the Alpine.js component using the Filament asset system. This ensures that the Alpine.js component is only loaded when it's needed, and not on every page load. To find out how to do this, check out our [Assets documentation](../assets#asynchronous-alpinejs-components).

### Custom field classes

You may create your own custom field classes and views, which you can reuse across your project, and even release as a plugin to the community.

To create a custom field class and view, you may use the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-form-field LocationPicker
```

This will create the following component class:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Field;

class LocationPicker extends Field
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.forms.components.location-picker';
}
```

It will also create a view file at `resources/views/filament/forms/components/location-picker.blade.php`.

<Aside variant="info">
    Filament form fields are **not** Livewire components. Defining public properties and methods on a form field class will not make them accessible in the Blade view.
</Aside>

## Accessing the state of another component in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the state of another component in the schema using the `$get()` function:

```blade
<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getFieldWrapperView()"
    :field="$field"
>
    {{ $get('email') }}
</x-dynamic-component>
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    Unless a form field is [reactive](../forms/overview#the-basics-of-reactivity), the Blade view will not refresh when the value of the field changes, only when the next user interaction occurs that makes a request to the server. If you need to react to changes in a field's value, it should be `live()`.
</Aside>

## Accessing the Eloquent record in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the current Eloquent record using the `$record` variable:

```blade
<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getFieldWrapperView()"
    :field="$field"
>
    {{ $record->name }}
</x-dynamic-component>
```

## Accessing the current operation in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the current operation, usually `create`, `edit` or `view`, using the `$operation` variable:

```blade
<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getFieldWrapperView()"
    :field="$field"
>
    @if ($operation === 'create')
        This is a new conference.
    @else
        This is an existing conference.
    @endif
</x-dynamic-component>
```

## Accessing the current Livewire component instance in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the current Livewire component instance using `$this`:

```blade
@php
    use Filament\Resources\Users\RelationManagers\ConferencesRelationManager;
@endphp

<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getFieldWrapperView()"
    :field="$field"
>
    @if ($this instanceof ConferencesRelationManager)
        You are editing conferences the of a user.
    @endif
</x-dynamic-component>
```

## Accessing the current field instance in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the current field instance using `$field`. You can call public methods on this object to access other information that may not be available in variables:

```blade
<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getFieldWrapperView()"
    :field="$field"
>
    @if ($field->getState())
        This is a new conference.
    @endif
</x-dynamic-component>
```

## Adding a configuration method to a custom field class

You may add a public method to the custom field class that accepts a configuration value, stores it in a protected property, and returns it again from another public method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Field;

class LocationPicker extends Field
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.forms.components.location-picker';
    
    protected ?float $zoom = null;

    public function zoom(?float $zoom): static
    {
        $this->zoom = $zoom;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getZoom(): ?float
    {
        return $this->zoom;
    }
}
```

Now, in the Blade view for the custom field, you may access the zoom using the `$getZoom()` function:

```blade
<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getFieldWrapperView()"
    :field="$field"
>
    {{ $getZoom() }}
</x-dynamic-component>
```

Any public method that you define on the custom field class can be accessed in the Blade view as a variable function in this way.

To pass the configuration value to the custom field class, you may use the public method:

```php
use App\Filament\Forms\Components\LocationPicker;

LocationPicker::make('location')
    ->zoom(0.5)
```

## Allowing utility injection in a custom field configuration method

[Utility injection](overview#field-utility-injection) is a powerful feature of Filament that allows users to configure a component using functions that can access various utilities. You can allow utility injection by ensuring that the parameter type and property type of the configuration allows the user to pass a `Closure`. In the getter method, you should pass the configuration value to the `$this->evaluate()` method, which will inject utilities into the user's function if they pass one, or return the value if it is static:

```php
use Closure;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Field;

class LocationPicker extends Field
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.forms.components.location-picker';
    
    protected float | Closure | null $zoom = null;

    public function zoom(float | Closure | null $zoom): static
    {
        $this->zoom = $zoom;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getZoom(): ?float
    {
        return $this->evaluate($this->zoom);
    }
}
```

Now, you can pass a static value or a function to the `zoom()` method, and [inject any utility](overview#component-utility-injection) as a parameter:

```php
use App\Filament\Forms\Components\LocationPicker;

LocationPicker::make('location')
    ->zoom(fn (Conference $record): float => $record->isGlobal() ? 1 : 0.5)
```

## Obeying state binding modifiers

When you bind a field to a state path, you may use the `defer` modifier to ensure that the state is only sent to the server when the user submits the form, or whenever the next Livewire request is made. This is the default behavior.

However, you may use the [`live()`](overview#the-basics-of-reactivity) on a field to ensure that the state is sent to the server immediately when the user interacts with the field. This allows for lots of advanced use cases as explained in the [reactivity](overview#the-basics-of-reactivity) section of the documentation.

Filament provides a `$applyStateBindingModifiers()` function that you may use in your view to apply any state binding modifiers to a `wire:model` or `$wire.$entangle()` binding:

```blade
<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getFieldWrapperView()"
    :field="$field"
>
    <input {{ $applyStateBindingModifiers('wire:model') }}="{{ $getStatePath() }}" />
    
    <!-- Or -->
    
    <div x-data="{ state: $wire.{{ $applyStateBindingModifiers("\$entangle('{$getStatePath()}')") }} }">
        <input x-model="state" />
    </div>
</x-dynamic-component>
```

## Introduction

Validation rules may be added to any [field](overview#available-fields).

In Laravel, validation rules are usually defined in arrays like `['required', 'max:255']` or a combined string like `required|max:255`. This is fine if you're exclusively working in the backend with simple form requests. But Filament is also able to give your users frontend validation, so they can fix their mistakes before any backend requests are made.

Filament includes many [dedicated validation methods](#available-rules), but you can also use any [other Laravel validation rules](#other-rules), including [custom validation rules](#custom-rules).

<Aside variant="warning">
    Some default Laravel validation rules rely on the correct attribute names and won't work when passed via `rule()`/`rules()`. Use the dedicated validation methods whenever you can.
</Aside>

## Available rules

### Active URL

The field must have a valid A or AAAA record according to the `dns_get_record()` PHP function. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-active-url)

```php
Field::make('name')->activeUrl()
```

### After (date)

The field value must be a value after a given date. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-after)

```php
Field::make('start_date')->after('tomorrow')
```

Alternatively, you may pass the name of another field to compare against:

```php
Field::make('start_date')
Field::make('end_date')->after('start_date')
```

### After or equal to (date)

The field value must be a date after or equal to the given date. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-after-or-equal)

```php
Field::make('start_date')->afterOrEqual('tomorrow')
```

Alternatively, you may pass the name of another field to compare against:

```php
Field::make('start_date')
Field::make('end_date')->afterOrEqual('start_date')
```

### Alpha

The field must be entirely alphabetic characters. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-alpha)

```php
Field::make('name')->alpha()
```

### Alpha Dash

The field may have alphanumeric characters, as well as dashes and underscores. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-alpha-dash)

```php
Field::make('name')->alphaDash()
```

### Alpha Numeric

The field must be entirely alphanumeric characters. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-alpha-num)

```php
Field::make('name')->alphaNum()
```

### ASCII

The field must be entirely 7-bit ASCII characters. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-ascii)

```php
Field::make('name')->ascii()
```

### Before (date)

The field value must be a date before a given date. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-before)

```php
Field::make('start_date')->before('first day of next month')
```

Alternatively, you may pass the name of another field to compare against:

```php
Field::make('start_date')->before('end_date')
Field::make('end_date')
```

### Before or equal to (date)

The field value must be a date before or equal to the given date. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-before-or-equal)

```php
Field::make('start_date')->beforeOrEqual('end of this month')
```

Alternatively, you may pass the name of another field to compare against:

```php
Field::make('start_date')->beforeOrEqual('end_date')
Field::make('end_date')
```

### Confirmed

The field must have a matching field of `{field}_confirmation`. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-confirmed)

```php
Field::make('password')->confirmed()
Field::make('password_confirmation')
```

### Different

The field value must be different to another. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-different)

```php
Field::make('backup_email')->different('email')
```

### Doesn't Start With

The field must not start with one of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-doesnt-start-with)

```php
Field::make('name')->doesntStartWith(['admin'])
```

### Doesn't End With

The field must not end with one of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-doesnt-end-with)

```php
Field::make('name')->doesntEndWith(['admin'])
```

### Ends With

The field must end with one of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-ends-with)

```php
Field::make('name')->endsWith(['bot'])
```

### Enum

The field must contain a valid enum value. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-enum)

```php
Field::make('status')->enum(MyStatus::class)
```

### Exists

The field value must exist in the database. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-exists)

```php
Field::make('invitation')->exists()
```

By default, the form's model will be searched, [if it is registered](../components/form#setting-a-form-model). You may specify a custom table name or model to search:

```php
use App\Models\Invitation;

Field::make('invitation')->exists(table: Invitation::class)
```

By default, the field name will be used as the column to search. You may specify a custom column to search:

```php
Field::make('invitation')->exists(column: 'id')
```

You can further customize the rule by passing a [closure](overview#closure-customization) to the `modifyRuleUsing` parameter:

```php
use Illuminate\Validation\Rules\Exists;

Field::make('invitation')
    ->exists(modifyRuleUsing: function (Exists $rule) {
        return $rule->where('is_active', 1);
    })
```

Laravel's `exists` validation rule does not use the Eloquent model to query the database by default, so it will not use any global scopes defined on the model, including for soft-deletes. As such, even if there is a soft-deleted record with the same value, the validation will pass.

Since global scopes are not applied, Filament's multi-tenancy feature also does not scope the query to the current tenant by default.

To do this, you should use the `scopedExists()` method instead, which replaces Laravel's `exists` implementation with one that uses the model to query the database, applying any global scopes defined on the model, including for soft-deletes and multi-tenancy:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('email')
    ->scopedExists()
```

If you would like to modify the Eloquent query used to check for presence, including to remove a global scope, you can pass a function to the `modifyQueryUsing` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletingScope;

TextInput::make('email')
    ->scopedExists(modifyQueryUsing: function (Builder $query) {
        return $query->withoutGlobalScope(SoftDeletingScope::class);
    })
```

### Filled

The field must not be empty when it is present. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-filled)

```php
Field::make('name')->filled()
```

### Greater than

The field value must be greater than another. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-gt)

```php
Field::make('newNumber')->gt('oldNumber')
```

### Greater than or equal to

The field value must be greater than or equal to another. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-gte)

```php
Field::make('newNumber')->gte('oldNumber')
```

### Hex color

The field value must be a valid color in hexadecimal format. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-hex-color)

```php
Field::make('color')->hexColor()
```

### In

The field must be included in the given list of values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-in)

```php
Field::make('status')->in(['pending', 'completed'])
```

The [toggle buttons](toggle-buttons), [checkbox list](checkbox-list), [radio](radio) and [select](select#valid-options-validation-in-rule) fields automatically apply the `in()` rule based on their available options, so you do not need to add it manually.

### Ip Address

The field must be an IP address. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-ip)

```php
Field::make('ip_address')->ip()
Field::make('ip_address')->ipv4()
Field::make('ip_address')->ipv6()
```

### JSON

The field must be a valid JSON string. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-json)

```php
Field::make('ip_address')->json()
```

### Less than

The field value must be less than another. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-lt)

```php
Field::make('newNumber')->lt('oldNumber')
```

### Less than or equal to

The field value must be less than or equal to another. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-lte)

```php
Field::make('newNumber')->lte('oldNumber')
```

### Mac Address

The field must be a MAC address. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-mac)

```php
Field::make('mac_address')->macAddress()
```

### Multiple Of

The field must be a multiple of value. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#multiple-of)

```php
Field::make('number')->multipleOf(2)
```

### Not In

The field must not be included in the given list of values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-not-in)

```php
Field::make('status')->notIn(['cancelled', 'rejected'])
```

### Not Regex

The field must not match the given regular expression. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-not-regex)

```php
Field::make('email')->notRegex('/^.+$/i')
```

### Nullable

The field value can be empty. This rule is applied by default if the `required` rule is not present. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-nullable)

```php
Field::make('name')->nullable()
```

### Prohibited

The field value must be empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-prohibited)

```php
Field::make('name')->prohibited()
```

### Prohibited If

The field must be empty *only if* the other specified field has any of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-prohibited-if)

```php
Field::make('name')->prohibitedIf('field', 'value')
```

### Prohibited Unless

The field must be empty *unless* the other specified field has any of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-prohibited-unless)

```php
Field::make('name')->prohibitedUnless('field', 'value')
```

### Prohibits

If the field is not empty, all other specified fields must be empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-prohibits)

```php
Field::make('name')->prohibits('field')

Field::make('name')->prohibits(['field', 'another_field'])
```

### Required

The field value must not be empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required)

```php
Field::make('name')->required()
```

#### Marking a field as required

By default, required fields will show an asterisk `*` next to their label. You may want to hide the asterisk on forms where all fields are required, or where it makes sense to add a [hint](#adding-a-hint-next-to-the-label) to optional fields instead:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->required() // Adds validation to ensure the field is required
    ->markAsRequired(false) // Removes the asterisk
```

If your field is not `required()`, but you still wish to show an asterisk `*` you can use `markAsRequired()` too:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->markAsRequired()
```

### Required If

The field value must not be empty _only if_ the other specified field has any of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-if)

```php
Field::make('name')->requiredIf('field', 'value')
```

### Required If Accepted

The field value must not be empty _only if_ the other specified field is equal to "yes", "on", 1, "1", true, or "true". [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-if-accepted)

```php
Field::make('name')->requiredIfAccepted('field')
```

### Required Unless

The field value must not be empty _unless_ the other specified field has any of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-unless)

```php
Field::make('name')->requiredUnless('field', 'value')
```

### Required With

The field value must not be empty _only if_ any of the other specified fields are not empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-with)

```php
Field::make('name')->requiredWith('field,another_field')
```

### Required With All

The field value must not be empty _only if_ all the other specified fields are not empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-with-all)

```php
Field::make('name')->requiredWithAll('field,another_field')
```

### Required Without

The field value must not be empty _only when_ any of the other specified fields are empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-without)

```php
Field::make('name')->requiredWithout('field,another_field')
```

### Required Without All

The field value must not be empty _only when_ all the other specified fields are empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-without-all)

```php
Field::make('name')->requiredWithoutAll('field,another_field')
```

### Regex

The field must match the given regular expression. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-regex)

```php
Field::make('email')->regex('/^.+@.+$/i')
```

### Same

The field value must be the same as another. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-same)

```php
Field::make('password')->same('passwordConfirmation')
```

### Starts With

The field must start with one of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-starts-with)

```php
Field::make('name')->startsWith(['a'])
```

### String

The field must be a string. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-string)
```php
Field::make('name')->string()
```

### Unique

The field value must not exist in the database. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-unique)

```php
Field::make('email')->unique()
```

If your Filament form already has an Eloquent model associated with it, such as in a [panel resource](../resources), Filament will use that. You may also specify a custom table name or model to search:

```php
use App\Models\User;

Field::make('email')->unique(table: User::class)
```

By default, the field name will be used as the column to search. You may specify a custom column to search:

```php
Field::make('email')->unique(column: 'email_address')
```

Usually, you wish to ignore a given model during unique validation. For example, consider an "update profile" form that includes the user's name, email address, and location. You will probably want to verify that the email address is unique. However, if the user only changes the name field and not the email field, you do not want a validation error to be thrown because the user is already the owner of the email address in question. If your Filament form already has an Eloquent model associated with it, such as in a [panel resource](../resources), Filament will ignore it.

To prevent Filament from ignoring the current Eloquent record, you can pass `false` to the `ignoreRecord` parameter:

```php
Field::make('email')->unique(ignoreRecord: false)
```

Alternatively, to ignore an Eloquent record of your choice, you can pass it to the `ignorable` parameter:

```php
Field::make('email')->unique(ignorable: $ignoredUser)
```

You can further customize the rule by passing a [closure](overview#closure-customization) to the `modifyRuleUsing` parameter:

```php
use Illuminate\Validation\Rules\Unique;

Field::make('email')
    ->unique(modifyRuleUsing: function (Unique $rule) {
        return $rule->where('is_active', 1);
    })
```

Laravel's `unique` validation rule does not use the Eloquent model to query the database by default, so it will not use any global scopes defined on the model, including for soft-deletes. As such, even if there is a soft-deleted record with the same value, the validation will fail.

Since global scopes are not applied, Filament's multi-tenancy feature also does not scope the query to the current tenant by default.

To do this, you should use the `scopedUnique()` method instead, which replaces Laravel's `unique` implementation with one that uses the model to query the database, applying any global scopes defined on the model, including for soft-deletes and multi-tenancy:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('email')
    ->scopedUnique()
```

If you would like to modify the Eloquent query used to check for uniqueness, including to remove a global scope, you can pass a function to the `modifyQueryUsing` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletingScope;

TextInput::make('email')
    ->scopedUnique(modifyQueryUsing: function (Builder $query) {
        return $query->withoutGlobalScope(SoftDeletingScope::class);
    })
```

### ULID

The field under validation must be a valid [Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier](https://github.com/ulid/spec) (ULID). [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-ulid)

```php
Field::make('identifier')->ulid()
```

### UUID

The field must be a valid RFC 4122 (version 1, 3, 4, or 5) universally unique identifier (UUID). [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-uuid)

```php
Field::make('identifier')->uuid()
```

## Other rules

You may add other validation rules to any field using the `rules()` method:

```php
TextInput::make('slug')->rules(['alpha_dash'])
```

A full list of validation rules may be found in the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#available-validation-rules).

## Custom rules

You may use any custom validation rules as you would do in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#custom-validation-rules):

```php
TextInput::make('slug')->rules([new Uppercase()])
```

You may also use [closure rules](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#using-closures):

```php
use Closure;

TextInput::make('slug')->rules([
    fn (): Closure => function (string $attribute, $value, Closure $fail) {
        if ($value === 'foo') {
            $fail('The :attribute is invalid.');
        }
    },
])
```

You may [inject utilities](overview#field-utility-injection) like [`$get`](overview#injecting-the-state-of-another-field) into your custom rules, for example if you need to reference other field values in your form. To do this, wrap the closure rule in another function that returns it:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

TextInput::make('slug')->rules([
    fn (Get $get): Closure => function (string $attribute, $value, Closure $fail) use ($get) {
        if ($get('other_field') === 'foo' && $value !== 'bar') {
            $fail("The {$attribute} is invalid.");
        }
    },
])
```

## Customizing validation attributes

When fields fail validation, their label is used in the error message. To customize the label used in field error messages, use the `validationAttribute()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->validationAttribute('full name')
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `validationAttribute()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Validation messages

By default Laravel's validation error message is used. To customize the error messages, use the `validationMessages()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('email')
    ->unique(// ...)
    ->validationMessages([
        'unique' => 'The :attribute has already been registered.',
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing an array of static value, the `validationMessages()` method also accepts a function for each message. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Allowing HTML in validation messages

By default, validation messages are rendered as plain text to prevent XSS attacks. However, you may need to render HTML in your validation messages, such as when displaying lists or links. To enable HTML rendering for validation messages, use the `allowHtmlValidationMessages()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->required()
    ->rules([
        new CustomRule(), // Custom rule that returns a validation message that contains HTML
    ])
    ->allowHtmlValidationMessages()
```

Be aware that you will need to ensure that the HTML in all validation messages is safe to render, otherwise your application will be vulnerable to XSS attacks.

## Disabling validation when fields are not dehydrated

When a field is [not dehydrated](overview#preventing-a-field-from-being-dehydrated), it is still validated. To disable validation for fields that are not dehydrated, use the `validatedWhenNotDehydrated()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->required()
    ->dehydrated(false)
    ->validatedWhenNotDehydrated(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `validatedWhenNotDehydrated()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/overview" alt="Product infolist example" version="4.x" />

Filament's infolists package lets you display a read-only list of data for a specific entity. It's integrated into other Filament packages, such as inside [panel resources](../panels/resources), [relation managers](../panels/resources/managing-relationships), and [action modals](../actions). Understanding how to use the infolist builder will save you time when building custom Livewire applications or working with other Filament features.

This guide covers the fundamentals of building infolists with Filament. If you want to add an infolist to your own Livewire component, [start here](../components/infolist) before continuing. If you're adding an infolist to an [panel resource](../panels/resources), or using another Filament package, you're ready to begin!

## Defining entries

Entry classes can be found in the `Filament\Infolists\Components` namespace. They reside within the schema array of components. Filament includes a number of entries built-in:

- [Text entry](text-entry)
- [Icon entry](icon-entry)
- [Image entry](image-entry)
- [Color entry](color-entry)
- [Code entry](code-entry)
- [Key-value entry](key-value-entry)
- [Repeatable entry](repeatable-entry)

You may also [create your own custom entries](custom-entries) to display data however you wish.

Entries may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its unique name. Usually, the name of an entry corresponds to the name of an attribute on an Eloquent model. You may use "dot notation" to access attributes within relationships:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')

TextEntry::make('author.name')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/simple" alt="Entries in an infolist" version="4.x" />

## Entry content (state)

Entries may feel a bit magic at first, but they are designed to be simple to use and optimized to display data from an Eloquent record. Despite this, they are flexible and you can display data from any source, not just an Eloquent record attribute.

The data that an entry displays is called its "state". When using a [panel resource](../resources), the infolist is aware of the record it is displaying. This means that the state of the entry is set based on the value of the attribute on the record. For example, if the entry is used in the infolist of a `PostResource`, then the `title` attribute value of the current post will be displayed.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
```

If you want to access the value stored in a relationship, you can use "dot notation". The name of the relationship that you would like to access data from comes first, followed by a dot, and then the name of the attribute:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('author.name')
```

You can also use "dot notation" to access values within a JSON / array column on an Eloquent model. The name of the attribute comes first, followed by a dot, and then the key of the JSON object you want to read from:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('meta.title')
```

### Setting the state of an entry

You can pass your own state to an entry by using the `state()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->state('Hello, world!')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">The `state()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the state. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Setting the default state of an entry

When an entry is empty (its state is `null`), you can use the `default()` method to define alternative state to use instead. This method will treat the default state as if it were real, so entries like [image](image-entry) or [color](color-entry) will display the default image or color.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->default('Untitled')
```

#### Adding placeholder text if an entry is empty

Sometimes you may want to display placeholder text for entries with an empty state, which is styled as a lighter gray text. This differs from the [default value](#setting-the-default-state-of-an-entry), as the placeholder is always text and not treated as if it were real state.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->placeholder('Untitled')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/placeholder" alt="Entry with a placeholder for empty state" version="4.x" />

## Setting an entry's label

By default, the label of the entry, which is displayed in the header of the infolist, is generated from the name of the entry. You may customize this using the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->label('Full name')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `label()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

Customizing the label in this way is useful if you wish to use a [translation string for localization](https://laravel.com/docs/localization#retrieving-translation-strings):

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->label(__('entries.name'))
```

### Hiding an entry's label

<Aside variant="tip">
    If you're looking to hide an entry's label, it might be the case that you are trying to use an entry for arbitrary text or UI. Entries are specifically designed to display data in a structured way, but [Prime components](../primes) are simple components that are used to render basic stand-alone static content, such as text, images, and buttons (actions). You may want to consider using a Prime component instead.
</Aside>

It may be tempting to set the label to an empty string to hide it, but this is not recommended. Setting the label to an empty string will not communicate the purpose of the entry to screen readers, even if the purpose is clear visually. Instead, you should use the `hiddenLabel()` method, so it is hidden visually but still accessible to screen readers:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->hiddenLabel()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the label should be hidden or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->hiddenLabel(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `hiddenLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Opening a URL when an entry is clicked

When an entry is clicked, you may open a URL. To do this, pass a URL to the `url()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->url('/about/titles')
```

You may pass a function to the `url()` method to dynamically calculate the URL. For example, you may want to access the current Eloquent record for the infolist by injecting `$record` as an argument:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $record]))
```

If you're using a [panel resource](../resources), you can generate a link to a page for the record using the `getUrl()` method:

```php
use App\Filament\Posts\PostResource;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => PostResource::getUrl('edit', ['record' => $record]))
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">The function passed to `url()` can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

You may also choose to open the URL in a new tab:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => PostResource::getUrl('edit', ['record' => $record]))
    ->openUrlInNewTab()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the URL should open in a new tab or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => PostResource::getUrl('edit', ['record' => $record]))
    ->openUrlInNewTab(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `openUrlInNewTab()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Hiding an entry

You may hide an entry:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('role')
    ->hidden()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the entry should be hidden or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('role')
    ->hidden(! FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `hidden()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

Alternatively, you may use the `visible()` method to control if the entry should be hidden or not. In some situations, this may help to make your code more readable:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('role')
    ->visible(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `visible()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="info">
    If both `hidden()` and `visible()` are used, they both need to indicate that the entry should be visible for it to be shown.
</Aside>

### Hiding an entry using JavaScript

If you need to hide an entry based on a user interaction, you can use the `hidden()` or `visible()` methods, passing a function that uses utilities injected to determine whether the entry should be hidden or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

Select::make('role')
    ->options([
        'user' => 'User',
        'staff' => 'Staff',
    ])
    ->live()

IconEntry::make('is_admin')
    ->boolean()
    ->hidden(fn (Get $get): bool => $get('role') !== 'staff')
```

In this example, the `role` field is set to `live()`, which means that the schema will reload the schema each time the `role` field is changed. This will cause the function that is passed to the `hidden()` method to be re-evaluated, which will hide the `is_admin` entry if the `role` field is not set to `staff`.

However, reloading the schema each time an entry causes a network request to be made, since there is no way to re-run the PHP function from the client-side. This is not ideal for performance.

Alternatively, you can write JavaScript to hide the entry based on the value of a field. This is done by passing a JavaScript expression to the `hiddenJs()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

Select::make('role')
    ->options([
        'user' => 'User',
        'staff' => 'Staff',
    ])

IconEntry::make('is_admin')
    ->boolean()
    ->hiddenJs(<<<'JS'
        $get('role') !== 'staff'
        JS)
```

Although the code passed to `hiddenJs()` looks very similar to PHP, it is actually JavaScript. Filament provides the `$get()` utility function to JavaScript that behaves very similar to its PHP equivalent, but without requiring the depended-on entry to be `live()`.

The `visibleJs()` method is also available, which works in the same way as `hiddenJs()`, but controls if the entry should be visible or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

Select::make('role')
    ->options([
        'user' => 'User',
        'staff' => 'Staff',
    ])
    
IconEntry::make('is_admin')
    ->boolean()
    ->visibleJs(<<<'JS'
        $get('role') === 'staff'
        JS)
```

<Aside variant="info">
    If both `hiddenJs()` and `visibleJs()` are used, they both need to indicate that the entry should be visible for it to be shown.
</Aside>

### Hiding an entry based on the current operation

The "operation" of a schema is the current action being performed on it. Usually, this is either `create`, `edit` or `view`, if you are using the [panel resource](../resources).

You can hide an entry based on the current operation by passing an operation to the `hiddenOn()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

IconEntry::make('is_admin')
    ->boolean()
    ->hiddenOn('edit')
    
// is the same as

IconEntry::make('is_admin')
    ->boolean()
    ->hidden(fn (string $operation): bool => $operation === 'edit')
```

You can also pass an array of operations to the `hiddenOn()` method, and the entry will be hidden if the current operation is any of the operations in the array:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

IconEntry::make('is_admin')
    ->boolean()
    ->hiddenOn(['edit', 'view'])
    
// is the same as

IconEntry::make('is_admin')
    ->boolean()
    ->hidden(fn (string $operation): bool => in_array($operation, ['edit', 'view']))
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    The `hiddenOn()` method will overwrite any previous calls to the `hidden()` method, and vice versa.
</Aside>

Alternatively, you may use the `visibleOn()` method to control if the entry should be hidden or not. In some situations, this may help to make your code more readable:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

IconEntry::make('is_admin')
    ->boolean()
    ->visibleOn('create')

IconEntry::make('is_admin')
    ->boolean()
    ->visibleOn(['create', 'edit'])
```

<Aside variant="info">
    The `visibleOn()` method will overwrite any previous calls to the `visible()` method, and vice versa.
</Aside>

## Inline labels

Entries may have their labels displayed inline with the entry, rather than above it. This is useful for infolists with many entries, where vertical space is at a premium. To display an entry's label inline, use the `inlineLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->inlineLabel()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/inline-label" alt="Infolist entry with inline label" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the label should be displayed inline or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->inlineLabel(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `inlineLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Using inline labels in multiple places at once

If you wish to display all labels inline in a [layout component](../schemas/layouts) like a [section](../schemas/section) or [tab](../schemas/tabs), you can use the `inlineLabel()` on the component itself, and all entries within it will have their labels displayed inline:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Details')
    ->inlineLabel()
    ->entries([
        TextInput::make('name'),
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->label('Email address'),
        TextInput::make('phone')
            ->label('Phone number'),
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/inline-label/section" alt="Infolist entries with inline labels in a section" version="4.x" />

You can also use `inlineLabel()` on the entire schema to display all labels inline:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

public function infolist(Schema $schema): Schema
{
    return $schema
        ->inlineLabel()
        ->components([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

When using `inlineLabel()` on a layout component or schema, you can still opt-out of inline labels for individual entries by using the `inlineLabel(false)` method on the entry:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Details')
    ->inlineLabel()
    ->entries([
        TextInput::make('name'),
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->label('Email address'),
        TextInput::make('phone')
            ->label('Phone number')
            ->inlineLabel(false),
    ])
```

## Adding a tooltip to an entry

You may specify a tooltip to display when you hover over an entry:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->tooltip('Shown at the top of the page')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `tooltip()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/tooltips" alt="Entry with tooltip" version="4.x" />

## Aligning entry content

You may align the content of an entry to the start (left in left-to-right interfaces, right in right-to-left interfaces), center, or end (right in left-to-right interfaces, left in right-to-left interfaces) using the `alignStart()`, `alignCenter()` or `alignEnd()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->alignStart() // This is the default alignment.

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->alignCenter()

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->alignEnd()
```

Alternatively, you may pass an `Alignment` enum to the `alignment()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->alignment(Alignment::Center)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `alignment()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Adding extra content to an entry

Entries contain many "slots" where content can be inserted in a child schema. Slots can accept text, [any schema component](../schemas), [actions](../actions) and [action groups](../actions/grouping-actions). Usually, [prime components](../schemas/primes) are used for content.

The following slots are available for all entries:

- `aboveLabel()`
- `beforeLabel()`
- `afterLabel()`
- `belowLabel()`
- `aboveContent()`
- `beforeContent()`
- `afterContent()`
- `belowContent()`

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the slot methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

To insert plain text, you can pass a string to these methods:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->belowContent('This is the user\'s full name.')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/below-content/text" alt="Infolist entry with text below content" version="4.x" />

To insert a schema component, often a [prime component](../schemas/primes), you can pass the component to the method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->belowContent(Text::make('This is the user\'s full name.')->weight(FontWeight::Bold))
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/below-content/component" alt="Infolist entry with component below content" version="4.x" />

To insert an [action](../actions) or [action group](../actions/grouping-actions), you can pass the action or action group to the method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->belowContent(Action::make('generate'))
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/below-content/action" alt="Infolist entry with action below content" version="4.x" />

You can insert any combination of content into the slots by passing an array of content to the method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->belowContent([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::InformationCircle),
        'This is the user\'s full name.',
        Action::make('generate'),
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/below-content" alt="Infolist entry with multiple components below content" version="4.x" />

You can also align the content in the slots by passing the array of content to either `Schema::start()` (default), `Schema::end()` or `Schema::between()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Flex;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->belowContent(Schema::end([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::InformationCircle),
        'This is the user\'s full name.',
        Action::make('generate'),
    ]))

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->belowContent(Schema::between([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::InformationCircle),
        'This is the user\'s full name.',
        Action::make('generate'),
    ]))

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->belowContent(Schema::between([
        Flex::make([
            Icon::make(Heroicon::InformationCircle)
                ->grow(false),
            'This is the user\'s full name.',
        ]),
        Action::make('generate'),
    ]))
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    As you can see in the above example for `Schema::between()`, a [`Flex` component](../schemas/layouts#flex-component) is used to group the icon and text together so they do not have space between them. The icon uses `grow(false)` to prevent it from taking up half of the horizontal space, allowing the text to consume the remaining space.
</Aside>

### Adding extra content above an entry's label

You can insert extra content above an entry's label using the `aboveLabel()` method. You can [pass any content](#adding-extra-content-to-a-entry) to this method, like text, a schema component, an action, or an action group:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->aboveLabel([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::Star),
        'This is the content above the entry\'s label'
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `aboveLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/above-label" alt="Infolist entry with extra content above label" version="4.x" />

### Adding extra content before an entry's label

You can insert extra content before an entry's label using the `beforeLabel()` method. You can [pass any content](#adding-extra-content-to-a-entry) to this method, like text, a schema component, an action, or an action group:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->beforeLabel(Icon::make(Heroicon::Star))
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `beforeLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/before-label" alt="Infolist entry with extra content before label" version="4.x" />

### Adding extra content after an entry's label

You can insert extra content after an entry's label using the `afterLabel()` method. You can [pass any content](#adding-extra-content-to-a-entry) to this method, like text, a schema component, an action, or an action group:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->afterLabel([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::Star),
        'This is the content after the entry\'s label'
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `afterLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/after-label" alt="Infolist entry with extra content after label" version="4.x" />

By default, the content in the `afterLabel()` schema is aligned to the end of the container. If you wish to align it to the start of the container, you should pass a `Schema::start()` object containing the content:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->afterLabel(Schema::start([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::Star),
        'This is the content after the entry\'s label'
    ]))
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `afterLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/after-label/aligned-start" alt="Infolist entry with extra content after label aligned to the start" version="4.x" />

### Adding extra content below an entry's label

You can insert extra content below an entry's label using the `belowLabel()` method. You can [pass any content](#adding-extra-content-to-a-entry) to this method, like text, a schema component, an action, or an action group:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->belowLabel([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::Star),
        'This is the content below the entry\'s label'
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `belowLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/below-label" alt="Infolist entry with extra content below label" version="4.x" />

<Aside variant="info">
    This may seem like the same as the [`aboveContent()` method](#adding-extra-content-above-a-entries-content). However, when using [inline labels](#inline-labels), the `aboveContent()` method will place the content above the entry, not below the label, since the label is displayed in a separate column to the entry content.
</Aside>

### Adding extra content above an entry's content

You can insert extra content above an entry's content using the `aboveContent()` method. You can [pass any content](#adding-extra-content-to-a-entry) to this method, like text, a schema component, an action, or an action group:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->aboveContent([
        Icon::make(Heroicon::Star),
        'This is the content above the entry\'s content'
    ])
```

### Adding extra content before an entry's content

You can insert extra content before an entry's content using the `beforeContent()` method. You can [pass any content](#adding-extra-content-to-a-entry) to this method, like text, a schema component, an action, or an action group:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->beforeContent(Icon::make(Heroicon::Star))
```

### Adding extra content after an entry's content

You can insert extra content after an entry's content using the `afterContent()` method. You can [pass any content](#adding-extra-content-to-a-entry) to this method, like text, a schema component, an action, or an action group:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->afterContent(Icon::make(Heroicon::Star))
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `afterContent()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/after-content" alt="Infolist entry with extra content after content" version="4.x" />

## Adding extra HTML attributes to an entry

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the entry via the `extraAttributes()` method, which will be merged onto its outer HTML element. The attributes should be represented by an array, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('slug')
    ->extraAttributes(['class' => 'bg-gray-200'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `extraAttributes()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, calling `extraAttributes()` multiple times will overwrite the previous attributes. If you wish to merge the attributes instead, you can pass `merge: true` to the method.

### Adding extra HTML attributes to the entry wrapper

You can also pass extra HTML attributes to the very outer element of the "entry wrapper" which surrounds the label and content of the entry. This is useful if you want to style the label or spacing of the entry via CSS, since you could target elements as children of the wrapper:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('slug')
    ->extraEntryWrapperAttributes(['class' => 'components-locked'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `extraEntryWrapperAttributes()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, calling `extraEntryWrapperAttributes()` multiple times will overwrite the previous attributes. If you wish to merge the attributes instead, you can pass `merge: true` to the method.

## Entry utility injection

The vast majority of methods used to configure entries accept functions as parameters instead of hardcoded values:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->label(fn (string $state): string => str_contains($state, ' ') ? 'Full name' : 'Name')

TextEntry::make('currentUserEmail')
    ->state(fn (): string => auth()->user()->email)

TextEntry::make('role')
    ->hidden(fn (User $record): bool => $record->role === 'admin')
```

This alone unlocks many customization possibilities.

The package is also able to inject many utilities to use inside these functions, as parameters. All customization methods that accept functions as arguments can inject utilities.

These injected utilities require specific parameter names to be used. Otherwise, Filament doesn't know what to inject.

### Injecting the current state of the entry

If you wish to access the current [value (state)](#entry-content-state) of the entry, define a `$state` parameter:

```php
function ($state) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the state of another entry or form field

You may also retrieve the state (value) of another entry or form field from within a callback, using a `$get` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

function (Get $get) {
    $email = $get('email'); // Store the value of the `email` entry in the `$email` variable.
    //...
}
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    Unless a form field is [reactive](../forms/overview#the-basics-of-reactivity), the schema will not refresh when the value of the field changes, only when the next user interaction occurs that makes a request to the server. If you need to react to changes in a field's value, it should be `live()`.
</Aside>

### Injecting the current Eloquent record

You may retrieve the Eloquent record for the current schema using a `$record` parameter:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

function (?Model $record) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current operation

If you're writing a schema for a panel resource or relation manager, and you wish to check if a schema is `create`, `edit` or `view`, use the `$operation` parameter:

```php
function (string $operation) {
    // ...
}
```

<Aside variant="info">
    You can manually set a schema's operation using the `$schema->operation()` method.
</Aside>

### Injecting the current Livewire component instance

If you wish to access the current Livewire component instance, define a `$livewire` parameter:

```php
use Livewire\Component;

function (Component $livewire) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current entry instance

If you wish to access the current component instance, define a `$component` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Entry;

function (Entry $component) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting multiple utilities

The parameters are injected dynamically using reflection, so you are able to combine multiple parameters in any order:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;
use Livewire\Component as Livewire;

function (Livewire $livewire, Get $get, User $record) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting dependencies from Laravel's container

You may inject anything from Laravel's container like normal, alongside utilities:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

function (Request $request, User $record) {
    // ...
}
```

## Global settings

If you wish to change the default behavior of all entries globally, then you can call the static `configureUsing()` method inside a service provider's `boot()` method, to which you pass a Closure to modify the entries using. For example, if you wish to make all `TextEntry` components [`words(10)`](text-entry#limiting-word-count), you can do it like so:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::configureUsing(function (TextEntry $entry): void {
    $entry->words(10);
});
```

Of course, you are still able to overwrite this on each entry individually:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->words(null)
```

## Introduction

Text entries display simple text:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/simple" alt="Text entry" version="4.x" />

## Customizing the color

You may set a [color](../styling/colors) for the text:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('status')
    ->color('primary')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `color()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/color" alt="Text entry in the primary color" version="4.x" />

## Adding an icon

Text entries may also have an [icon](../styling/icons):

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextEntry::make('email')
    ->icon(Heroicon::Envelope)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">The `icon()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the icon. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/icon" alt="Text entry with icon" version="4.x" />

You may set the position of an icon using `iconPosition()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Support\Enums\IconPosition;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextEntry::make('email')
    ->icon(Heroicon::Envelope)
    ->iconPosition(IconPosition::After) // `IconPosition::Before` or `IconPosition::After`
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">The `iconPosition()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the icon position. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/icon-after" alt="Text entry with icon after" version="4.x" />

The icon color defaults to the text color, but you may customize the icon [color](../styling/colors) separately using `iconColor()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextEntry::make('email')
    ->icon(Heroicon::Envelope)
    ->iconColor('primary')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">The `iconColor()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the icon color. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/icon-color" alt="Text entry with icon in the primary color" version="4.x" />

## Displaying as a "badge"

By default, text is quite plain and has no background color. You can make it appear as a "badge" instead using the `badge()` method. A great use case for this is with statuses, where may want to display a badge with a [color](#customizing-the-color) that matches the status:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('status')
    ->badge()
    ->color(fn (string $state): string => match ($state) {
        'draft' => 'gray',
        'reviewing' => 'warning',
        'published' => 'success',
        'rejected' => 'danger',
    })
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/badge" alt="Text entry as badge" version="4.x" />

You may add other things to the badge, like an [icon](#adding-an-icon).

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should be in a badge or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('status')
    ->badge(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `badge()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Formatting

When using a text entry, you may want the actual outputted text in the UI to differ from the raw [state](overview#entry-content-state) of the entry, which is often automatically retrieved from an Eloquent model. Formatting the state allows you to preserve the integrity of the raw data while also allowing it to be presented in a more user-friendly way.

To format the state of a text entry without changing the state itself, you can use the `formatStateUsing()` method. This method accepts a function that takes the state as an argument and returns the formatted state:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('status')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => __("statuses.{$state}"))
```

In this case, the `status` column in the database might contain values like `draft`, `reviewing`, `published`, or `rejected`, but the formatted state will be the translated version of these values.

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">The function passed to `formatStateUsing()` can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Date formatting

Instead of passing a function to `formatStateUsing()`, you may use the `date()`, `dateTime()`, and `time()` methods to format the entry's state using [PHP date formatting tokens](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php):

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->date()

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->dateTime()

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->time()
```

You may customize the date format by passing a custom format string to the `date()`, `dateTime()`, or `time()` method. You may use any [PHP date formatting tokens](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php):

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->date('M j, Y')
    
TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->dateTime('M j, Y H:i:s')
    
TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->time('H:i:s')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `date()`, `dateTime()`, and `time()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate the format. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Date formatting using Carbon macro formats

You may use also the `isoDate()`, `isoDateTime()`, and `isoTime()` methods to format the entry's state using [Carbon's macro-formats](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#available-macro-formats):

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->isoDate()

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->isoDateTime()

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->isoTime()
```

You may customize the date format by passing a custom macro format string to the `isoDate()`, `isoDateTime()`, or `isoTime()` method. You may use any [Carbon's macro-formats](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#available-macro-formats):

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->isoDate('L')

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->isoDateTime('LLL')

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->isoTime('LT')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `isoDate()`, `isoDateTime()`, and `isoTime()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate the format. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Relative date formatting

You may use the `since()` method to format the entry's state using [Carbon's `diffForHumans()`](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#api-humandiff):

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->since()
```

#### Displaying a formatting date in a tooltip

Additionally, you can use the `dateTooltip()`, `dateTimeTooltip()`, `timeTooltip()`, `isoDateTooltip()`, `isoDateTimeTooltip()`, `isoTime()`, `isoTimeTooltip()`, or `sinceTooltip()` method to display a formatted date in a [tooltip](overview#adding-a-tooltip-to-an-entry), often to provide extra information:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->since()
    ->dateTooltip() // Accepts a custom PHP date formatting string

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->since()
    ->dateTimeTooltip() // Accepts a custom PHP date formatting string

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->since()
    ->timeTooltip() // Accepts a custom PHP date formatting string

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->since()
    ->isoDateTooltip() // Accepts a custom Carbon macro format string

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->since()
    ->isoDateTimeTooltip() // Accepts a custom Carbon macro format string

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->since()
    ->isoTimeTooltip() // Accepts a custom Carbon macro format string

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->dateTime()
    ->sinceTooltip()
```

#### Setting the timezone for date formatting

Each of the date formatting methods listed above also accepts a `timezone` argument, which allows you to convert the time set in the state to a different timezone:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->dateTime(timezone: 'America/New_York')
```

You can also pass a timezone to the `timezone()` method of the entry to apply a timezone to all date-time formatting methods at once:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->timezone('America/New_York')
    ->dateTime()
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `timezone()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the timezone. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

If you do not pass a `timezone()` to the entry, it will use Filament's default timezone. You can set Filament's default timezone using the `FilamentTimezone::set()` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider such as `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentTimezone;

public function boot(): void
{
    FilamentTimezone::set('America/New_York');
}
```

This is useful if you want to set a default timezone for all text entries in your application. It is also used in other places where timezones are used in Filament.

<Aside variant="warning">
    Filament's default timezone will only apply when the entry stores a time. If the entry stores a date only (`date()` instead of `dateTime()`), the timezone will not be applied. This is to prevent timezone shifts when storing dates without times.
</Aside>

### Number formatting

Instead of passing a function to `formatStateUsing()`, you can use the `numeric()` method to format an entry as a number:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('stock')
    ->numeric()
```

If you would like to customize the number of decimal places used to format the number with, you can use the `decimalPlaces` argument:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('stock')
    ->numeric(decimalPlaces: 0)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `decimalPlaces` argument also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, your app's locale will be used to format the number suitably. If you would like to customize the locale used, you can pass it to the `locale` argument:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('stock')
    ->numeric(locale: 'nl')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `locale` argument also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Money formatting

Instead of passing a function to `formatStateUsing()`, you can use the `money()` method to easily format amounts of money, in any currency:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('price')
    ->money('EUR')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `money()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

There is also a `divideBy` argument for `money()` that allows you to divide the original value by a number before formatting it. This could be useful if your database stores the price in cents, for example:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('price')
    ->money('EUR', divideBy: 100)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `divideBy` argument also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, your app's locale will be used to format the money suitably. If you would like to customize the locale used, you can pass it to the `locale` argument:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('price')
    ->money('EUR', locale: 'nl')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `locale` argument also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

If you would like to customize the number of decimal places used to format the number with, you can use the `decimalPlaces` argument:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('price')
    ->money('EUR', decimalPlaces: 3)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `decimalPlaces` argument also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Rendering Markdown

If your entry value is Markdown, you may render it using `markdown()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->markdown()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should be rendered as Markdown or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->markdown(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `markdown()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Rendering HTML

If your entry value is HTML, you may render it using `html()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->html()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should be rendered as HTML or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->html(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `html()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Rendering raw HTML without sanitization

If you use this method, then the HTML will be sanitized to remove any potentially unsafe content before it is rendered. If you'd like to opt out of this behavior, you can wrap the HTML in an `HtmlString` object by formatting it:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): HtmlString => new HtmlString($state))
```

<Aside variant="danger">
    Be cautious when rendering raw HTML, as it may contain malicious content, which can lead to security vulnerabilities in your app such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Always ensure that the HTML you are rendering is safe before using this method.
</Aside>

Alternatively, you can return a `view()` object from the `formatStateUsing()` method, which will also not be sanitized:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): View => view(
        'filament.infolists.components.description-entry-content',
        ['state' => $state],
    ))
```

## Listing multiple values

Multiple values can be rendered in a text entry if its [state](overview#entry-content-state) is an array. This can happen if you are using an `array` cast on an Eloquent attribute, an Eloquent relationship with multiple results, or if you have passed an array to the [`state()` method](overview#setting-the-state-of-an-entry). If there are multiple values inside your text entry, they will be comma-separated. You may use the `listWithLineBreaks()` method to display them on new lines instead:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/list" alt="Text entry with multiple values" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should have line breaks between each item or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `listWithLineBreaks()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Adding bullet points to the list

You may add a bullet point to each list item using the `bulleted()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('authors.name')
    ->bulleted()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/bullet-list" alt="Text entry with multiple values and bullet points" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should have bullet points or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('authors.name')
    ->bulleted(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `bulleted()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Limiting the number of values in the list

You can limit the number of values in the list using the `limitList()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
    ->limitList(3)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `limitList()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Expanding the limited list

You can allow the limited items to be expanded and collapsed, using the `expandableLimitedList()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
    ->limitList(3)
    ->expandableLimitedList()
```

<Aside variant="info">
    This is only a feature for `listWithLineBreaks()` or `bulleted()`, where each item is on its own line.
</Aside>

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should be expandable or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
    ->limitList(3)
    ->expandableLimitedList(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `expandableLimitedList()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Splitting a single value into multiple list items

If you want to "explode" a text string from your model into multiple list items, you can do so with the `separator()` method. This is useful for displaying comma-separated tags [as badges](#displaying-as-a-badge), for example:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('tags')
    ->badge()
    ->separator(',')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `separator()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Aggregating relationships

Filament provides several methods for aggregating a relationship field, including `avg()`, `max()`, `min()` and `sum()`. For instance, if you wish to show the average of a field on all related records, you may use the `avg()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('users_avg_age')->avg('users', 'age')
```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship, while `age` is the field that is being averaged. The name of the entry must be `users_avg_age`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#other-aggregate-functions) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextEntry::make('users_avg_age')->avg([
    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
], 'age')
```

## Customizing the text size

Text entries have small font size by default, but you may change this to `TextSize::ExtraSmall`, `TextSize::Medium`, or `TextSize::Large`.

For instance, you may make the text larger using `size(TextSize::Large)`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Support\Enums\TextSize;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->size(TextSize::Large)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/large" alt="Text entry in a large font size" version="4.x" />

## Customizing the font weight

Text entries have regular font weight by default, but you may change this to any of the following options: `FontWeight::Thin`, `FontWeight::ExtraLight`, `FontWeight::Light`, `FontWeight::Medium`, `FontWeight::SemiBold`, `FontWeight::Bold`, `FontWeight::ExtraBold` or `FontWeight::Black`.

For instance, you may make the font bold using `weight(FontWeight::Bold)`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `weight()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/bold" alt="Text entry in a bold font" version="4.x" />

## Customizing the font family

You can change the text font family to any of the following options: `FontFamily::Sans`, `FontFamily::Serif` or `FontFamily::Mono`.

For instance, you may make the font monospaced using `fontFamily(FontFamily::Mono)`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontFamily;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('apiKey')
    ->label('API key')
    ->fontFamily(FontFamily::Mono)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `fontFamily()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/mono" alt="Text entry in a monospaced font" version="4.x" />

## Handling long text

### Limiting text length

You may `limit()` the length of the entry's value:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->limit(50)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `limit()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, when text is truncated, an ellipsis (`...`) is appended to the end of the text. You may customize this by passing a custom string to the `end` argument:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->limit(50, end: ' (more)')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `end` argument also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

You may also reuse the value that is being passed to `limit()` in a function, by getting it using the `getCharacterLimit()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->limit(50)
    ->tooltip(function (TextEntry $component): ?string {
        $state = $component->getState();

        if (strlen($state) <= $component->getCharacterLimit()) {
            return null;
        }

        // Only render the tooltip if the entry contents exceeds the length limit.
        return $state;
    })
```

### Limiting word count

You may limit the number of `words()` displayed in the entry:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->words(10)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `words()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, when text is truncated, an ellipsis (`...`) is appended to the end of the text. You may customize this by passing a custom string to the `end` argument:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->words(10, end: ' (more)')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `end` argument also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Limiting text to a specific number of lines

You may want to limit text to a specific number of lines instead of limiting it to a fixed length. Clamping text to a number of lines is useful in responsive interfaces where you want to ensure a consistent experience across all screen sizes. This can be achieved using the `lineClamp()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->lineClamp(2)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `lineClamp()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Preventing text wrapping

By default, text will wrap to the next line if it exceeds the width of the container. You can prevent this behavior using the `wrap(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->wrap(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `wrap()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Allowing the text to be copied to the clipboard

You may make the text copyable, such that clicking on the entry copies the text to the clipboard, and optionally specify a custom confirmation message and duration in milliseconds:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('apiKey')
    ->label('API key')
    ->copyable()
    ->copyMessage('Copied!')
    ->copyMessageDuration(1500)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/copyable" alt="Text entry with a button to copy it" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should be copyable or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('apiKey')
    ->label('API key')
    ->copyable(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `copyable()`, `copyMessage()`, and `copyMessageDuration()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

Icon entries render an [icon](../styling/icons) representing the state of the entry:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

IconEntry::make('status')
    ->icon(fn (string $state): string => match ($state) {
        'draft' => Heroicon::OutlinedPencil,
        'reviewing' => Heroicon::OutlinedClock,
        'published' => Heroicon::OutlinedCheckCircle,
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">The `icon()` method can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/icon/simple" alt="Icon entry" version="4.x" />

## Customizing the color

You may change the [color](../styling/colors) of the icon, using the `color()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

IconEntry::make('status')
    ->color('success')
```

By passing a function to `color()`, you can customize the color based on the state of the entry:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

IconEntry::make('status')
    ->color(fn (string $state): string => match ($state) {
        'draft' => 'info',
        'reviewing' => 'warning',
        'published' => 'success',
        default => 'gray',
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">The `color()` method can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/icon/color" alt="Icon entry with color" version="4.x" />

## Customizing the size

The default icon size is `IconSize::Large`, but you may customize the size to be either `IconSize::ExtraSmall`, `IconSize::Small`, `IconSize::Medium`, `IconSize::ExtraLarge` or `IconSize::TwoExtraLarge`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;
use Filament\Support\Enums\IconSize;

IconEntry::make('status')
    ->size(IconSize::Medium)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `size()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/icon/medium" alt="Medium-sized icon entry" version="4.x" />

## Handling booleans

Icon entries can display a check or "X" icon based on the state of the entry, either true or false, using the `boolean()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

IconEntry::make('is_featured')
    ->boolean()
```

> If this attribute in the model class is already cast as a `bool` or `boolean`, Filament is able to detect this, and you do not need to use `boolean()` manually.

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/icon/boolean" alt="Icon entry to display a boolean" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the icon should be boolean or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

IconEntry::make('is_featured')
    ->boolean(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `boolean()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing the boolean icons

You may customize the [icon](../styling/icons) representing each state:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

IconEntry::make('is_featured')
    ->boolean()
    ->trueIcon(Heroicon::OutlinedCheckBadge)
    ->falseIcon(Heroicon::OutlinedXMark)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `trueIcon()` and `falseIcon()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/icon/boolean-icon" alt="Icon entry to display a boolean with custom icons" version="4.x" />

### Customizing the boolean colors

You may customize the icon [color](../styling/colors) representing each state:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

IconEntry::make('is_featured')
    ->boolean()
    ->trueColor('info')
    ->falseColor('warning')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `trueColor()` and `falseColor()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/icon/boolean-color" alt="Icon entry to display a boolean with custom colors" version="4.x" />

## Introduction

Infolists can render images, based on the path in the state of the entry:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('header_image')
```

In this case, the `header_image` state could contain `posts/header-images/4281246003439.jpg`, which is relative to the root directory of the storage disk. The storage disk is defined in the [configuration file](../introduction/installation#publishing-configuration), `public` by default. You can also set the `FILESYSTEM_DISK` environment variable to change this.

Alternatively, the state could contain an absolute URL to an image, such as `https://example.com/images/header.jpg`.

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/image/simple" alt="Image entry" version="4.x" />

## Managing the image disk

The default storage disk is defined in the [configuration file](../introduction/installation#publishing-configuration), `public` by default. You can also set the `FILESYSTEM_DISK` environment variable to change this. If you want to deviate from the default disk, you may pass a custom disk name to the `disk()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('header_image')
    ->disk('s3')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `disk()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Public images

By default, Filament will generate temporary URLs to images in the filesystem, unless the [disk](#managing-the-image-disk) is set to `public`. If your images are stored in a public disk, you can set the `visibility()` to `public`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('header_image')
    ->visibility('public')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `visibility()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the size

You may customize the image size by passing a `imageWidth()` and `imageHeight()`, or both with `imageSize()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('header_image')
    ->imageWidth(200)

ImageEntry::make('header_image')
    ->imageHeight(50)

ImageEntry::make('author.avatar')
    ->imageSize(40)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static values, the `imageWidth()`, `imageHeight()` and `imageSize()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Square images

You may display the image using a 1:1 aspect ratio:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('author.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->square()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/image/square" alt="Square image entry" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the image should be square or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('author.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->square(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `square()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Circular images

You may make the image fully rounded, which is useful for rendering avatars:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('author.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/image/circular" alt="Circular image entry" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the image should be circular or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('author.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `circular()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Adding a default image URL

You can display a placeholder image if one doesn't exist yet, by passing a URL to the `defaultImageUrl()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('header_image')
    ->defaultImageUrl(url('storage/posts/header-images/default.jpg'))
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `defaultImageUrl()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Stacking images

You may display multiple images as a stack of overlapping images by using `stacked()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/image/stacked" alt="Stacked image entry" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the images should be stacked or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `stacked()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing the stacked ring width

The default ring width is `3`, but you may customize it to be from `0` to `8`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->ring(5)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `ring()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing the stacked overlap

The default overlap is `4`, but you may customize it to be from `0` to `8`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->overlap(2)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `overlap()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Setting a limit

You may limit the maximum number of images you want to display by passing `limit()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `limit()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/image/limited" alt="Limited image entry" version="4.x" />

### Showing the remaining images count

When you set a limit you may also display the count of remaining images by passing `limitedRemainingText()`.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
    ->limitedRemainingText()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/image/limited-remaining-text" alt="Limited image entry with remaining text" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the remaining text should be displayed or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
    ->limitedRemainingText(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `limitedRemainingText()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Customizing the limited remaining text size

By default, the size of the remaining text is `TextSize::Small`. You can customize this to be `TextSize::ExtraSmall`, `TextSize::Medium` or `TextSize::Large` using the `size` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;
use Filament\Support\Enums\TextSize;

ImageEntry::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
    ->limitedRemainingText(size: TextSize::Large)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `limitedRemainingText()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Prevent file existence checks

When the schema is loaded, it will automatically detect whether the images exist to prevent errors for missing files. This is all done on the backend. When using remote storage with many images, this can be time-consuming. You can use the `checkFileExistence(false)` method to disable this feature:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('attachment')
    ->checkFileExistence(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `checkFileExistence()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Adding extra HTML attributes to the image

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the `<img>` element via the `extraImgAttributes()` method. The attributes should be represented by an array, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('logo')
    ->extraImgAttributes([
        'alt' => 'Logo',
        'loading' => 'lazy',
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `extraImgAttributes()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, calling `extraImgAttributes()` multiple times will overwrite the previous attributes. If you wish to merge the attributes instead, you can pass `merge: true` to the method.

## Introduction

The color entry allows you to show the color preview from a CSS color definition, typically entered using the [color picker field](../forms/color-picker), in one of the supported formats (HEX, HSL, RGB, RGBA).

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ColorEntry;

ColorEntry::make('color')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/color/simple" alt="Color entry" version="4.x" />

## Allowing the color to be copied to the clipboard

You may make the color copyable, such that clicking on the preview copies the CSS value to the clipboard, and optionally specify a custom confirmation message and duration in milliseconds. This feature only works when SSL is enabled for the app.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ColorEntry;

ColorEntry::make('color')
    ->copyable()
    ->copyMessage('Copied!')
    ->copyMessageDuration(1500)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/color/copyable" alt="Color entry with a button to copy it" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the color should be copyable or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ColorEntry;

ColorEntry::make('color')
    ->copyable(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `copyable()`, `copyMessage()`, and `copyMessageDuration()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

The code entry allows you to present a highlighted code snippet in your infolist. It uses [Phiki](https://github.com/phikiphp/phiki) for code highlighting on the server:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\CodeEntry;
use Phiki\Grammar\Grammar;

CodeEntry::make('code')
    ->grammar(Grammar::Php)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/code/simple" alt="Code entry" version="4.x" />

To use the code entry, you need to first install the [`phiki/phiki`](https://github.com/phikiphp/phiki) Composer package. Filament does not include it by default to allow you to choose which major version of Phiki to use explicitly, since major versions can have different grammars and themes available. You can install the latest version of Phiki using the following command:

```bash
composer require phiki/phiki
```

## Changing the code's grammar (language)

You may change the grammar (language) of the code using the `grammar()` method. Over 200 grammars are available, and you can open the `Phiki\Grammar\Grammar` enum class to see the full list. To switch to use JavaScript as the grammar, you can use the `Grammar::Javascript` enum value:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\CodeEntry;
use Phiki\Grammar\Grammar;

CodeEntry::make('code')
    ->grammar(Grammar::Javascript)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `grammar()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="tip">
    If your code entry's content is a PHP array, it will automatically be converted to a JSON string, and the grammar will be set to `Grammar::Json`.
</Aside>

## Changing the code's theme (highlighting)

You may change the theme of the code using the `lightTheme()` and `darkTheme()` methods. Over 50 themes are available, and you can open the `Phiki\Theme\Theme` enum class to see the full list. To use the popular `Dracula` theme, you can use the `Theme::Dracula` enum value:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\CodeEntry;
use Phiki\Theme\Theme;

CodeEntry::make('code')
    ->lightTheme(Theme::Dracula)
    ->darkTheme(Theme::Dracula)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `lightTheme()` and `darkTheme()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/code/dracula" alt="Code entry with the Dracula theme" version="4.x" />

## Allowing the code to be copied to the clipboard

You may make the code copyable, such that clicking on it copies the code to the clipboard, and optionally specify a custom confirmation message and duration in milliseconds. This feature only works when SSL is enabled for the app.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\CodeEntry;

CodeEntry::make('code')
    ->copyable()
    ->copyMessage('Copied!')
    ->copyMessageDuration(1500)
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the code should be copyable or not:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\CodeEntry;

CodeEntry::make('code')
    ->copyable(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `copyable()`, `copyMessage()`, and `copyMessageDuration()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

title: Key-value entry
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

The key-value entry allows you to render key-value pairs of data, from a one-dimensional JSON object / PHP array.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\KeyValueEntry;

KeyValueEntry::make('meta')
```

For example, the state of this entry might be represented as:

```php
[
    'description' => 'Filament is a collection of Laravel packages',
    'og:type' => 'website',
    'og:site_name' => 'Filament',
]
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/key-value/simple" alt="Key-value entry" version="4.x" />

If you're saving the data in Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    { 
        return [
            'meta' => 'array',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Customizing the key column's label

You may customize the label for the key column using the `keyLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\KeyValueEntry;

KeyValueEntry::make('meta')
    ->keyLabel('Property name')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `keyLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the value column's label

You may customize the label for the value column using the `valueLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\KeyValueEntry;

KeyValueEntry::make('meta')
    ->valueLabel('Property value')
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `valueLabel()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

title: Repeatable entry
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

The repeatable entry allows you to repeat a set of entries and layout components for items in an array or relationship.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\RepeatableEntry;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

RepeatableEntry::make('comments')
    ->schema([
        TextEntry::make('author.name'),
        TextEntry::make('title'),
        TextEntry::make('content')
            ->columnSpan(2),
    ])
    ->columns(2)
```

As you can see, the repeatable entry has an embedded `schema()` which gets repeated for each item.

For example, the state of this entry might be represented as:

```php
[
    [
        'author' => ['name' => 'Jane Doe'],
        'title' => 'Wow!',
        'content' => 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam euismod, nisl eget aliquam ultricies, nunc nisl aliquet nunc, quis aliquam nisl.',
    ],
    [
        'author' => ['name' => 'John Doe'],
        'title' => 'This isn\'t working. Help!',
        'content' => 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam euismod, nisl eget aliquam ultricies, nunc nisl aliquet nunc, quis aliquam nisl.',
    ],
]
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/repeatable/simple" alt="Repeatable entry" version="4.x" />

Alternatively, `comments` and `author` could be Eloquent relationships, `title` and `content` could be attributes on the comment model, and `name` could be an attribute on the author model. Filament will automatically handle the relationship loading and display the data in the same way.

## Grid layout

You may organize repeatable items into columns by using the `grid()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\RepeatableEntry;

RepeatableEntry::make('comments')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->grid(2)
```

This method accepts the same options as the `columns()` method of the [grid](../schemas/layouts#grid-system). This allows you to responsively customize the number of grid columns at various breakpoints.

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `grid()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/repeatable/grid" alt="Repeatable entry in grid layout" version="4.x" />

## Removing the styled container

By default, each item in a repeatable entry is wrapped in a container styled as a card. You may remove the styled container using `contained()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\RepeatableEntry;

RepeatableEntry::make('comments')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->contained(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="infolistEntries" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `contained()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

title: Custom entries
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

## Introduction

You may create your own custom entry classes and views, which you can reuse across your project, and even release as a plugin to the community.

To create a custom entry class and view, you may use the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-infolist-entry AudioPlayerEntry
```

This will create the following component class:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Entry;

class AudioPlayerEntry extends Entry
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.infolists.components.audio-player-entry';
}
```

It will also create a view file at `resources/views/filament/infolists/components/audio-player-entry.blade.php`.

<Aside variant="info">
    Filament infolist entries are **not** Livewire components. Defining public properties and methods on a infolist entry class will not make them accessible in the Blade view.
</Aside>

## Accessing the state of the entry in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the [state](overview#entry-content-state) of the entry using the `$getState()` function:

```blade
<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getEntryWrapperView()"
    :entry="$entry"
>
    {{ $getState() }}
</x-dynamic-component>
```

## Accessing the state of another component in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the state of another component in the schema using the `$get()` function:

```blade
<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getEntryWrapperView()"
    :entry="$entry"
>
    {{ $get('email') }}
</x-dynamic-component>
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    Unless a form field is [reactive](../infolists/overview#the-basics-of-reactivity), the Blade view will not refresh when the value of the field changes, only when the next user interaction occurs that makes a request to the server. If you need to react to changes in a field's value, it should be `live()`.
</Aside>

## Accessing the Eloquent record in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the current Eloquent record using the `$record` variable:

```blade
<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getEntryWrapperView()"
    :entry="$entry"
>
    {{ $record->name }}
</x-dynamic-component>
```

## Accessing the current operation in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the current operation, usually `create`, `edit` or `view`, using the `$operation` variable:

```blade
<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getEntryWrapperView()"
    :entry="$entry"
>
    @if ($operation === 'create')
        This is a new conference.
    @else
        This is an existing conference.
    @endif
</x-dynamic-component>
```

## Accessing the current Livewire component instance in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the current Livewire component instance using `$this`:

```blade
@php
    use Filament\Resources\Users\RelationManagers\ConferencesRelationManager;
@endphp

<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getEntryWrapperView()"
    :entry="$entry"
>
    @if ($this instanceof ConferencesRelationManager)
        You are editing conferences the of a user.
    @endif
</x-dynamic-component>
```

## Accessing the current entry instance in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the current entry instance using `$entry`. You can call public methods on this object to access other information that may not be available in variables:

```blade
<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getEntryWrapperView()"
    :entry="$entry"
>
    @if ($entry->isLabelHidden())
        This is a new conference.
    @endif
</x-dynamic-component>
```

## Adding a configuration method to a custom entry class

You may add a public method to the custom entry class that accepts a configuration value, stores it in a protected property, and returns it again from another public method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Entry;

class AudioPlayerEntry extends Entry
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.infolists.components.audio-player-entry';
    
    protected ?float $speed = null;

    public function speed(?float $speed): static
    {
        $this->speed = $speed;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getSpeed(): ?float
    {
        return $this->speed;
    }
}
```

Now, in the Blade view for the custom entry, you may access the speed using the `$getSpeed()` function:

```blade
<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getEntryWrapperView()"
    :entry="$entry"
>
    {{ $getSpeed() }}
</x-dynamic-component>
```

Any public method that you define on the custom entry class can be accessed in the Blade view as a variable function in this way.

To pass the configuration value to the custom entry class, you may use the public method:

```php
use App\Filament\Infolists\Components\AudioPlayerEntry;

AudioPlayerEntry::make('recording')
    ->speed(0.5)
```

## Allowing utility injection in a custom entry configuration method

[Utility injection](overview#entry-utility-injection) is a powerful feature of Filament that allows users to configure a component using functions that can access various utilities. You can allow utility injection by ensuring that the parameter type and property type of the configuration allows the user to pass a `Closure`. In the getter method, you should pass the configuration value to the `$this->evaluate()` method, which will inject utilities into the user's function if they pass one, or return the value if it is static:

```php
use Closure;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Entry;

class AudioPlayerEntry extends Entry
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.infolists.components.audio-player-entry';
    
    protected float | Closure | null $speed = null;

    public function speed(float | Closure | null $speed): static
    {
        $this->speed = $speed;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getSpeed(): ?float
    {
        return $this->evaluate($this->speed);
    }
}
```

Now, you can pass a static value or a function to the `speed()` method, and [inject any utility](overview#component-utility-injection) as a parameter:

```php
use App\Filament\Infolists\Components\AudioPlayerEntry;

AudioPlayerEntry::make('recording')
    ->speed(fn (Conference $record): float => $record->isGlobal() ? 1 : 0.5)
```

title: Overview
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Introduction

Notifications are sent using a `Notification` object that's constructed through a fluent API. Calling the `send()` method on the `Notification` object will dispatch the notification and display it in your application. As the session is used to flash notifications, they can be sent from anywhere in your code, including JavaScript, not just Livewire components.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Livewire;

use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Livewire\Component;

class EditPost extends Component
{
    public function save(): void
    {
        // ...

        Notification::make()
            ->title('Saved successfully')
            ->success()
            ->send();
    }
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="notifications/success" alt="Success notification" version="4.x" />

## Setting a title

The main message of the notification is shown in the title. You can set the title as follows:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->send();
```

The title text can contain basic, safe HTML elements. To generate safe HTML with Markdown, you can use the [`Str::markdown()` helper](https://laravel.com/docs/strings#method-str-markdown): `title(Str::markdown('Saved **successfully**'))`

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .send()
```

## Setting an icon

Optionally, a notification can have an [icon](../styling/icons) that's displayed in front of its content. You may also set a color for the icon, which is gray by default:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->icon('heroicon-o-document-text')
    ->iconColor('success')
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .icon('heroicon-o-document-text')
    .iconColor('success')
    .send()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="notifications/icon" alt="Notification with icon" version="4.x" />

Notifications often have a status like `success`, `warning`, `danger` or `info`. Instead of manually setting the corresponding [icons](../styling/icons) and [colors](../styling/colors), there's a `status()` method which you can pass the status. You may also use the dedicated `success()`, `warning()`, `danger()` and `info()` methods instead. So, cleaning up the above example would look like this:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .send()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="notifications/statuses" alt="Notifications with various statuses" version="4.x" />

## Setting a background color

Notifications have no background color by default. You may want to provide additional context to your notification by setting a color as follows:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->color('success')
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .color('success')
    .send()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="notifications/color" alt="Notification with background color" version="4.x" />

## Setting a duration

By default, notifications are shown for 6 seconds before they're automatically closed. You may specify a custom duration value in milliseconds as follows:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->duration(5000)
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .duration(5000)
    .send()
```

If you prefer setting a duration in seconds instead of milliseconds, you can do so:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->seconds(5)
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .seconds(5)
    .send()
```

You might want some notifications to not automatically close and require the user to close them manually. This can be achieved by making the notification persistent:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->persistent()
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .persistent()
    .send()
```

## Setting body text

Additional notification text can be shown in the `body()`:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    ->send();
```

The body text can contain basic, safe HTML elements. To generate safe HTML with Markdown, you can use the [`Str::markdown()` helper](https://laravel.com/docs/strings#method-str-markdown): `body(Str::markdown('Changes to the **post** have been saved.'))`

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    .send()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="notifications/body" alt="Notification with body text" version="4.x" />

## Adding actions to notifications

Notifications support [Actions](../actions/overview), which are buttons that render below the content of the notification. They can open a URL or dispatch a Livewire event. Actions can be defined as follows:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    ->actions([
        Action::make('view')
            ->button(),
        Action::make('undo')
            ->color('gray'),
    ])
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    .actions([
        new FilamentNotificationAction('view')
            .button(),
        new FilamentNotificationAction('undo')
            .color('gray'),
    ])
    .send()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="notifications/actions" alt="Notification with actions" version="4.x" />

You can learn more about how to style action buttons [here](../actions/overview).

### Opening URLs from notification actions

You can open a URL, optionally in a new tab, when clicking on an action:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    ->actions([
        Action::make('view')
            ->button()
            ->url(route('posts.show', $post), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
        Action::make('undo')
            ->color('gray'),
    ])
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    .actions([
        new FilamentNotificationAction('view')
            .button()
            .url('/view')
            .openUrlInNewTab(),
        new FilamentNotificationAction('undo')
            .color('gray'),
    ])
    .send()
```

### Dispatching Livewire events from notification actions

Sometimes you want to execute additional code when a notification action is clicked. This can be achieved by setting a Livewire event which should be dispatched on clicking the action. You may optionally pass an array of data, which will be available as parameters in the event listener on your Livewire component:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    ->actions([
        Action::make('view')
            ->button()
            ->url(route('posts.show', $post), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
        Action::make('undo')
            ->color('gray')
            ->dispatch('undoEditingPost', [$post->id]),
    ])
    ->send();
```

You can also `dispatchSelf` and `dispatchTo`:

```php
Action::make('undo')
    ->color('gray')
    ->dispatchSelf('undoEditingPost', [$post->id])

Action::make('undo')
    ->color('gray')
    ->dispatchTo('another_component', 'undoEditingPost', [$post->id])
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    .actions([
        new FilamentNotificationAction('view')
            .button()
            .url('/view')
            .openUrlInNewTab(),
        new FilamentNotificationAction('undo')
            .color('gray')
            .dispatch('undoEditingPost'),
    ])
    .send()
```

Similarly, `dispatchSelf` and `dispatchTo` are also available:

```js
new FilamentNotificationAction('undo')
    .color('gray')
    .dispatchSelf('undoEditingPost')

new FilamentNotificationAction('undo')
    .color('gray')
    .dispatchTo('another_component', 'undoEditingPost')
```

### Closing notifications from actions

After opening a URL or dispatching an event from your action, you may want to close the notification right away:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    ->actions([
        Action::make('view')
            ->button()
            ->url(route('posts.show', $post), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
        Action::make('undo')
            ->color('gray')
            ->dispatch('undoEditingPost', [$post->id])
            ->close(),
    ])
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    .actions([
        new FilamentNotificationAction('view')
            .button()
            .url('/view')
            .openUrlInNewTab(),
        new FilamentNotificationAction('undo')
            .color('gray')
            .dispatch('undoEditingPost')
            .close(),
    ])
    .send()
```

## Using the JavaScript objects

The JavaScript objects (`FilamentNotification` and `FilamentNotificationAction`) are assigned to `window.FilamentNotification` and `window.FilamentNotificationAction`, so they are available in on-page scripts.

You may also import them in a bundled JavaScript file:

```js
import { Notification, NotificationAction } from '../../vendor/filament/notifications/dist/index.js'

// ...
```

## Closing a notification with JavaScript

Once a notification has been sent, you can close it on demand by dispatching a browser event on the window called `close-notification`.

The event needs to contain the ID of the notification you sent. To get the ID, you can use the `getId()` method on the `Notification` object:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

$notification = Notification::make()
    ->title('Hello')
    ->persistent()
    ->send()

$notificationId = $notification->getId()
```

To close the notification, you can dispatch the event from Livewire:

```php
$this->dispatch('close-notification', id: $notificationId);
```

Or from JavaScript, in this case Alpine.js:

```blade
<button x-on:click="$dispatch('close-notification', { id: notificationId })" type="button">
    Close Notification
</button>
```

If you are able to retrieve the notification ID, persist it, and then use it to close the notification, that is the recommended approach, as IDs are generated uniquely, and you will not risk closing the wrong notification. However, if it is not possible to persist the random ID, you can pass in a custom ID when sending the notification:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make('greeting')
    ->title('Hello')
    ->persistent()
    ->send()
```

In this case, you can close the notification by dispatching the event with the custom ID:

```blade
<button x-on:click="$dispatch('close-notification', { id: 'greeting' })" type="button">
    Close Notification
</button>
```

Please be aware that if you send multiple notifications with the same ID, you may experience unexpected side effects, so random IDs are recommended.

## Positioning notifications

You can configure the alignment of the notifications in a service provider or middleware, by calling `Notifications::alignment()` and `Notifications::verticalAlignment()`. You can pass `Alignment::Start`, `Alignment::Center`, `Alignment::End`, `VerticalAlignment::Start`, `VerticalAlignment::Center` or `VerticalAlignment::End`:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Livewire\Notifications;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;
use Filament\Support\Enums\VerticalAlignment;

Notifications::alignment(Alignment::Start);
Notifications::verticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment::End);
```

title: Database notifications
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

<AutoScreenshot name="notifications/database" alt="Database notifications" version="4.x" />

## Setting up the notifications database table

Before we start, make sure that the [Laravel notifications table](https://laravel.com/docs/notifications#database-prerequisites) is added to your database:

```bash
# Laravel 11 and higher
php artisan make:notifications-table

# Laravel 10
php artisan notifications:table
```

> If you're using PostgreSQL, make sure that the `data` column in the migration is using `json()`: `$table->json('data')`.

> If you're using UUIDs for your `User` model, make sure that your `notifiable` column is using `uuidMorphs()`: `$table->uuidMorphs('notifiable')`.

## Enabling database notifications in a panel

If you'd like to receive database notifications in a panel, you can enable them in the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->databaseNotifications();
}
```

## Sending database notifications

There are several ways to send database notifications, depending on which one suits you best.

You may use our fluent API:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

$recipient = auth()->user();

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->sendToDatabase($recipient);
```

Or, use the `notify()` method:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

$recipient = auth()->user();

$recipient->notify(
    Notification::make()
        ->title('Saved successfully')
        ->toDatabase(),
);
```

> Laravel sends database notifications using the queue. Ensure your queue is running in order to receive the notifications.

Alternatively, use a traditional [Laravel notification class](https://laravel.com/docs/notifications#generating-notifications) by returning the notification from the `toDatabase()` method:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

public function toDatabase(User $notifiable): array
{
    return Notification::make()
        ->title('Saved successfully')
        ->getDatabaseMessage();
}
```

## Receiving database notifications

Without any setup, new database notifications will only be received when the page is first loaded.

### Polling for new database notifications

Polling is the practice of periodically making a request to the server to check for new notifications. This is a good approach as the setup is simple, but some may say that it is not a scalable solution as it increases server load.

By default, Livewire polls for new notifications every 30 seconds:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->databaseNotifications()
        ->databaseNotificationsPolling('30s');
}
```

You may completely disable polling if you wish:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->databaseNotifications()
        ->databaseNotificationsPolling(null);
}
```

### Using Echo to receive new database notifications with websockets

Websockets are a more efficient way to receive new notifications in real-time. To set up websockets, you must [configure it](broadcast-notifications#setting-up-websockets-in-a-panel) in the panel first.

Once websockets are set up, you can automatically dispatch a `DatabaseNotificationsSent` event by setting the `isEventDispatched` parameter to `true` when sending the notification. This will trigger the immediate fetching of new notifications for the user:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

$recipient = auth()->user();

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->sendToDatabase($recipient, isEventDispatched: true);
```

## Marking database notifications as read

There is a button at the top of the modal to mark all notifications as read at once. You may also add [Actions](overview#adding-actions-to-notifications) to notifications, which you can use to mark individual notifications as read. To do this, use the `markAsRead()` method on the action:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    ->actions([
        Action::make('view')
            ->button()
            ->markAsRead(),
    ])
    ->send();
```

Alternatively, you may use the `markAsUnread()` method to mark a notification as unread:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    ->actions([
        Action::make('markAsUnread')
            ->button()
            ->markAsUnread(),
    ])
    ->send();
```

## Opening the database notifications modal

You can open the database notifications modal from anywhere by dispatching an `open-modal` browser event:

```blade
<button
    x-data="{}"
    x-on:click="$dispatch('open-modal', { id: 'database-notifications' })"
    type="button"
>
    Notifications
</button>

title: Broadcast notifications
---

## Introduction

By default, Filament will send flash notifications via the Laravel session. However, you may wish that your notifications are "broadcast" to a user in real-time, instead. This could be used to send a temporary success notification from a queued job after it has finished processing.

We have a native integration with [Laravel Echo](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#client-side-installation). Make sure Echo is installed, as well as a [server-side websockets integration](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#server-side-installation) like Pusher.

## Sending broadcast notifications

There are several ways to send broadcast notifications, depending on which one suits you best.

You may use our fluent API:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

$recipient = auth()->user();

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->broadcast($recipient);
```

Or, use the `notify()` method:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

$recipient = auth()->user();

$recipient->notify(
    Notification::make()
        ->title('Saved successfully')
        ->toBroadcast(),
)
```

Alternatively, use a traditional [Laravel notification class](https://laravel.com/docs/notifications#generating-notifications) by returning the notification from the `toBroadcast()` method:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\BroadcastMessage;

public function toBroadcast(User $notifiable): BroadcastMessage
{
    return Notification::make()
        ->title('Saved successfully')
        ->getBroadcastMessage();
}
```

## Setting up websockets in a panel

The Panel Builder comes with a level of inbuilt support for real-time broadcast and database notifications. However there are a number of areas you will need to install and configure to wire everything up and get it working.

1. If you haven't already, read up on [broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting) in the Laravel documentation.
2. Install and configure broadcasting to use a [server-side websockets integration](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#server-side-installation) like Pusher.
3. If you haven't already, you will need to publish the Filament package configuration:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-config
```

4. Edit the configuration at `config/filament.php` and uncomment the `broadcasting.echo` section - ensuring the settings are correctly configured according to your broadcasting installation.
5. Ensure the [relevant `VITE_*` entries](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#client-pusher-channels) exist in your `.env` file.
6. Clear relevant caches with `php artisan route:clear` and `php artisan config:clear` to ensure your new configuration takes effect.

Your panel should now be connecting to your broadcasting service. For example, if you log into the Pusher debug console you should see an incoming connection each time you load a page.

## Introduction

Schemas form the foundation of Filament's Server-Driven UI approach. They allow you to build user interfaces declaratively using PHP configuration objects. These configuration objects represent components that define the structure and behavior of your UI, such as forms, tables, or lists. Rather than manually writing HTML or JavaScript, you create these schemas to control what gets rendered on the server, streamlining development and ensuring consistency across your app.

Schemas are used extensively across Filament to render UI elements dynamically. Whether you're defining a form field, the layout of your page, or an action button, the schema object defines both the component's configuration and how it interacts with your data. In essence, schemas are the building blocks of Filament UIs.

Filament packages provide you with various components. You can find a full list in the [available components section](#available-components):

- [Form fields](../forms) accept input from the user, for example, a text input, a select, or a checkbox. They come with integrated validation.
- [Infolist entries](../infolists) are components for rendering "description lists." Entries are key-value UI elements that can present read-only information like text, icons, and images. The data for an infolist can be sourced from anywhere but commonly comes from an individual Eloquent record.
- [Layout components](layouts) are used to structure the components. For example, a grid, tabs, or a multi-step form wizard.
- [Prime components](primes) are simple components that are used to render basic stand-alone static content, such as text, images, and buttons (actions).

Schemas act as a container for many components, and you can add any combination of components within them. Components can also nest child schemas within them, allowing for an infinite level of nesting.

A schema is represented by a `Filament\Schemas\Schema` object, and you can pass an array of components to it in the `components()` method.

## Available components

For building [forms](../forms), Filament includes a set of fields for different data types:

- [Text input](../forms/text-input)
- [Select](../forms/select)
- [Checkbox](../forms/checkbox)
- [Toggle](../forms/toggle)
- [Checkbox list](../forms/checkbox-list)
- [Radio](../forms/radio)
- [Date-time picker](../forms/date-time-picker)
- [File upload](../forms/file-upload)
- [Rich editor](../forms/rich-editor)
- [Markdown editor](../forms/markdown-editor)
- [Repeater](../forms/repeater)
- [Builder](../forms/builder)
- [Tags input](../forms/tags-input)
- [Textarea](../forms/textarea)
- [Key-value](../forms/key-value)
- [Color picker](../forms/color-picker)
- [Toggle buttons](../forms/toggle-buttons)
- [Slider](../forms/slider)
- [Code editor](../forms/code-editor)
- [Hidden](../forms/hidden)
- Or, build your own [custom form field](../forms/custom-fields)

For displaying data in a label-value "description list" format, Filament includes [infolist](../infolists) entry components:

- [Text entry](../infolists/text-entry)
- [Icon entry](../infolists/icon-entry)
- [Image entry](../infolists/image-entry)
- [Color entry](../infolists/color-entry)
- [Code entry](../infolists/code-entry)
- [Key-value entry](../infolists/key-value-entry)
- [Repeatable entry](../infolists/repeatable-entry)
- Or, build your own [custom infolist entry](../infolists/custom-entries)

To arrange components into a [layout](layouts), Filament includes layout components:

- [Grid](layouts#grid-component)
- [Flex](layouts#flex-component)
- [Fieldset](layouts#fieldset-component)
- [Section](sections)
- [Tabs](tabs)
- [Wizard](wizards)
- Or, build your own [custom layout component](custom-components#custom-layout-components)

For displaying arbitrary content, Filament includes [prime](primes) components:

- [Text](primes#text-component)
- [Icon](primes#icon-component)
- [Image](primes#image-component)
- [Unordered list](primes#unordered-list-component)

You can also insert "action" buttons into schemas. These can run PHP functions, and even open modals. For more information, see the [actions documentation](../actions).

You can learn more about building custom components to render your own Blade views in the [custom components documentation](custom-components).

## An example schema

For example, you may want to build a form with a schema. The name of the schema is usually dictated by the name of the method that it is defined in (`form` in this example). Filament creates the `Schema` object and passes it to the method, which then returns the schema with the components added:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

$schema
    ->components([
        Grid::make(2)
            ->schema([
                Section::make('Details')
                    ->schema([
                        TextInput::make('name'),
                        Select::make('position')
                            ->options([
                                'developer' => 'Developer',
                                'designer' => 'Designer',
                            ]),
                        Checkbox::make('is_admin'),
                    ]),
                Section::make('Auditing')
                    ->schema([
                        TextEntry::make('created_at')
                            ->dateTime(),
                        TextEntry::make('updated_at')
                            ->dateTime(),
                    ]),
            ]),
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/overview/example" alt="Example schema" version="4.x" />

[Grid](layouts#grid-component) is a layout component that renders multiple components together in a responsive grid. The number of columns in the grid is specified in the `make()` method. The `schema()` method is used to nest components within the grid.

[Section](sections) is another layout component that renders multiple components together in a card, with a heading at the top.

[TextInput](../forms/text-input), [Select](../forms/select), and [Checkbox](../forms/checkbox) are form components that accept input from the user.

[TextEntry](../infolists/text-entry) is an infolist component that displays read-only information. In this example, it is used to display the created and updated timestamps of the record. The `dateTime()` method is used to format the timestamps as dates and times.

The schema object is the container for the components and can now be rendered. Rendering the schema will render all the components within it in the correct layout.

## Component utility injection

The vast majority of methods used to configure entries accept functions as parameters instead of hardcoded values:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Grid::make(fn (): array => [
    'lg' => auth()->user()->isAdmin() ? 4 : 6,
])->schema([
    // ...
])

Section::make()
    ->heading(fn (): string => auth()->user()->isAdmin() ? 'Admin Dashboard' : 'User Dashboard')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

This alone unlocks many customization possibilities.

The package is also able to inject many utilities to use inside these functions, as parameters. All customization methods that accept functions as arguments can inject utilities.

These injected utilities require specific parameter names to be used. Otherwise, Filament doesn't know what to inject.

### Injecting the state of another component

You may also retrieve the state (value) of a form field or infolist entry from within a callback, using a `$get` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

function (Get $get) {
    $email = $get('email'); // Store the value of the `email` entry in the `$email` variable.
    //...
}
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    Unless a form field is [reactive](../forms/overview#the-basics-of-reactivity), the schema will not refresh when the value of the field changes, only when the next user interaction occurs that makes a request to the server. If you need to react to changes in a field's value, it should be `live()`.
</Aside>

### Injecting the current Eloquent record

You may retrieve the Eloquent record for the current schema using a `$record` parameter:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

function (?Model $record) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current operation

If you're writing a schema for a panel resource or relation manager, and you wish to check if a schema is `create`, `edit` or `view`, use the `$operation` parameter:

```php
function (string $operation) {
    // ...
}
```

<Aside variant="info">
    You can manually set a schema's operation using the `$schema->operation()` method.
</Aside>

### Injecting the current Livewire component instance

If you wish to access the current Livewire component instance, define a `$livewire` parameter:

```php
use Livewire\Component;

function (Component $livewire) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current component instance

If you wish to access the current component instance, define a `$component` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Component;

function (Component $component) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting multiple utilities

The parameters are injected dynamically using reflection, so you are able to combine multiple parameters in any order:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;
use Livewire\Component as Livewire;

function (Livewire $livewire, Get $get, Set $set) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting dependencies from Laravel's container

You may inject anything from Laravel's container like normal, alongside utilities:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

function (Request $request, Set $set) {
    // ...
}
```

## Global settings

If you wish to change the default behavior of a component globally, then you can call the static `configureUsing()` method inside a service provider's `boot()` method, to which you pass a Closure to modify the component using. For example, if you wish to make all section components have [2 columns](sections#using-grid-columns-within-a-section) by default, you can do it like so:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::configureUsing(function (Section $section): void {
    $section
        ->columns(2);
});
```

Of course, you are still able to overwrite this on each component individually:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make()
    ->columns(1)
```

## Introduction

Filament's grid system allows you to create responsive, multi-column layouts using any layout component. Filament provides a set of built-in layout components to help you build these:

- [Grid](#grid-component)
- [Flex](#flex-component)
- [Fieldset](#fieldset-component)
- [Section](sections)
- [Tabs](tabs)
- [Wizard](wizards)

You may also [create your own custom layout components](custom-components#custom-layout-components) to display components however you wish.

## Grid system

All layout components have a `columns()` method that you can use in a couple of different ways:

- You can pass an integer like `columns(2)`. This integer is the number of columns used on the `lg` breakpoint and higher. All smaller devices will have just 1 column.
- You can pass an array, where the key is the breakpoint and the value is the number of columns. For example, `columns(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will create a 2 column layout on medium devices, and a 4 column layout on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.

Breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`) are defined by Tailwind, and can be found in the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview).

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `columns()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Grid column spans

In addition to specifying how many columns a layout component should have, you may also specify how many columns a component should fill within the parent grid, using the `columnSpan()` method. This method accepts an integer or an array of breakpoints and column spans:

- `columnSpan(2)` will make the component fill up to 2 columns on all breakpoints.
- `columnSpan(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will make the component fill up to 2 columns on medium devices, and up to 4 columns on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.
- `columnSpan('full')` or `columnSpanFull()` or `columnSpan(['default' => 'full'])` will make the component fill the full width of the parent grid, regardless of how many columns it has.

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `columnSpan()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Grid column starts

If you want to start a component in a grid at a specific column, you can use the `columnStart()` method. This method accepts an integer, or an array of breakpoints and which column the component should start at:

- `columnStart(2)` will make the component start at column 2 on all breakpoints.
- `columnStart(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will make the component start at column 2 on medium devices, and at column 4 on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;

Grid::make()
    ->columns([
        'sm' => 3,
        'xl' => 6,
        '2xl' => 8,
    ])
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->columnStart([
                'sm' => 2,
                'xl' => 3,
                '2xl' => 4,
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

In this example, the grid has 3 columns on small devices, 6 columns on extra large devices, and 8 columns on extra extra large devices. The text input will start at column 2 on small devices, column 3 on extra large devices, and column 4 on extra extra large devices. This is essentially producing a layout whereby the text input always starts halfway through the grid, regardless of how many columns the grid has.

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `columnStart()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Grid column ordering

If you want to control the visual order of components in a grid without changing their position in the markup, you can use the `columnOrder()` method. This method accepts an integer, a closure, or an array of breakpoints and order values:

- `columnOrder(2)` will set the component's order to 2 on all breakpoints.
- `columnOrder(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will set the component's order to 2 on medium devices, and to 4 on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses the default order, unless you use a `default` array key.
- `columnOrder(fn () => 1)` will dynamically calculate the order using a closure.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;

Grid::make()
    ->columns(3)
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('first')
            ->columnOrder(3), // This will appear last
        TextInput::make('second')
            ->columnOrder(1), // This will appear first
        TextInput::make('third')
            ->columnOrder(2), // This will appear second
    ])
```

You can also use responsive ordering to change the visual order of components based on the screen size:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;

Grid::make()
    ->columns([
        'sm' => 2,
        'lg' => 3,
    ])
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('title')
            ->columnOrder([
                'default' => 1,
                'lg' => 3,
            ]),
        TextInput::make('description')
            ->columnOrder([
                'default' => 2,
                'lg' => 1,
            ]),
        TextInput::make('category')
            ->columnOrder([
                'default' => 3,
                'lg' => 2,
            ]),
    ])
```

In this example, on small screens the order will be: title, description, category. On large screens, the order will be: description, category, title.

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `columnOrder()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### An example of a responsive grid layout

In this example, we have a schema with a [section](sections) layout component. Since all layout components support the `columns()` method, we can use it to create a responsive grid layout within the section itself.

We pass an array to `columns()` as we want to specify different numbers of columns for different breakpoints. On devices smaller than the `sm` [Tailwind breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview), we want to have 1 column, which is default. On devices larger than the `sm` breakpoint, we want to have 3 columns. On devices larger than the `xl` breakpoint, we want to have 6 columns. On devices larger than the `2xl` breakpoint, we want to have 8 columns.

Inside the section, we have a [text input](../forms/text-input). Since text inputs are form fields and all components have a `columnSpan()` method, we can use it to specify how many columns the text input should fill. On devices smaller than the `sm` breakpoint, we want the text input to fill 1 column, which is default. On devices larger than the `sm` breakpoint, we want the text input to fill 2 columns. On devices larger than the `xl` breakpoint, we want the text input to fill 3 columns. On devices larger than the `2xl` breakpoint, we want the text input to fill 4 columns.

Additionally, we're using the `columnOrder()` method to control the visual order of components in the grid based on screen size. This allows us to change the display order without altering the markup structure.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make()
    ->columns([
        'sm' => 3,
        'xl' => 6,
        '2xl' => 8,
    ])
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->columnSpan([
                'default' => 1,
                'sm' => 2,
                'xl' => 3,
                '2xl' => 4,
            ])
            ->columnOrder([
                'default' => 2,
                'xl' => 1,
            ]),
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->columnSpan([
                'default' => 1,
                'xl' => 2,
            ])
            ->columnOrder([
                'default' => 1,
                'xl' => 2,
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

In this example, on screens smaller than the `xl` breakpoint, the email field will appear first followed by the name field. On screens larger than the `xl` breakpoint, the order is reversed with the name field appearing first followed by the email field.

## Basic layout components

### Grid component

All layout components support the `columns()` method, but you also have access to an additional `Grid` component. If you feel that your schema would benefit from an explicit grid syntax with no extra styling, it may be useful to you. Instead of using the `columns()` method, you can pass your column configuration directly to `Grid::make()`:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;

Grid::make([
    'default' => 1,
    'sm' => 2,
    'md' => 3,
    'lg' => 4,
    'xl' => 6,
    '2xl' => 8,
])
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

### Flex component

The `Flex` component allows you to define layouts with flexible widths, using flexbox. This component does not use Filament's [grid system](#grid-system).

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Flex;

Flex::make([
    Section::make([
        TextInput::make('title'),
        Textarea::make('content'),
    ]),
    Section::make([
        Toggle::make('is_published'),
        Toggle::make('is_featured'),
    ])->grow(false),
])->from('md')
```

In this example, the first section will `grow()` to consume available horizontal space, without affecting the amount of space needed to render the second section. This creates a flexible width sidebar effect.

The `from()` method is used to control the [Tailwind breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`) at which the horizontally-split layout should be used. In this example, the horizontally-split layout will be used on medium devices and larger. On smaller devices, the sections will stack on top of each other.

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `grow()` and `from()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/flex/simple" alt="Flex" version="4.x" />

### Fieldset component

You may want to group fields into a Fieldset. Each fieldset has a label, a border, and a two-column grid by default:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Fieldset;

Fieldset::make('Label')
    ->columns([
        'default' => 1,
        'md' => 2,
        'xl' => 3,
    ])
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static label, the `make()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/fieldset/simple" alt="Fieldset" version="4.x" />

### Removing the border from a fieldset

You can remove the container border from a fieldset using the `contained(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Fieldset;

Fieldset::make('Label')
    ->contained(false)
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `contained()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Using container queries

In addition to traditional breakpoints based on the size of the viewport, you can also use [container queries](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#container-queries) to create responsive layouts based on the size of a parent container. This is particularly useful when the size of the parent container is not directly tied to the size of the viewport. For example, when using a collapsible sidebar alongside the content, the content area dynamically adjusts its size depending on the collapse state of the sidebar.

The foundation of a container query is the container itself. The container is the element whose width determines the layout. To designate an element as a container, use the `gridContainer()` method on it. For instance, if you want to define the number of grid columns in a [`Grid` component] based on its width:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;

Grid::make()
    ->gridContainer()
    ->columns([
        // ...
    ])
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

Once an element is specified as a grid container, the element or any of its children can utilize [container breakpoints](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#container-size-reference) instead of standard breakpoints. For example, you could use `@md` to define the number of grid columns when the container's width is at least `448px`, and `@xl` for when the width is at least `576px`.

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;

Grid::make()
    ->gridContainer()
    ->columns([
        '@md' => 3,
        '@xl' => 4,
    ])
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

You can also use container breakpoints in the `columnSpan()`, `columnStart()`, and `columnOrder()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;

Grid::make()
    ->gridContainer()
    ->columns([
        '@md' => 3,
        '@xl' => 4,
    ])
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->columnSpan([
                '@md' => 2,
                '@xl' => 3,
            ])
            ->columnOrder([
                'default' => 2,
                '@xl' => 1,
            ]),
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->columnSpan([
                'default' => 1,
                '@xl' => 1,
            ])
            ->columnOrder([
                'default' => 1,
                '@xl' => 2,
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

In this example, when the container width is smaller than the `@xl` breakpoint (576px), the email field will appear first followed by the name field. When the container width is at least 576px, the order is reversed with the name field appearing first followed by the email field.

### Supporting container queries on older browsers

Container queries are not yet widely [supported in browsers](https://caniuse.com/css-container-queries) compared to traditional breakpoints. To support older browsers, you can define an additional layer of breakpoints alongside the container breakpoints. By prefixing the traditional breakpoint with `!@`, you can specify that the fallback breakpoint should be used when container queries are not supported in the browser. 

For example, if you want to use the `@md` container breakpoint for the grid columns but also support older browsers, you can define the `!@md` fallback breakpoint, which will be applied when container queries are unavailable:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;

Grid::make()
    ->gridContainer()
    ->columns([
        '@md' => 3,
        '@xl' => 4,
        '!@md' => 2,
        '!@xl' => 3,
    ])
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

You can also use `!@` fallback breakpoints in the `columnSpan()`, `columnStart()`, and `columnOrder()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;

Grid::make()
    ->gridContainer()
    ->columns([
        '@md' => 3,
        '@xl' => 4,
        '!@md' => 2,
        '!@xl' => 3,
    ])
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->columnSpan([
                '@md' => 2,
                '@xl' => 3,
                '!@md' => 2,
                '!@xl' => 2,
            ])
            ->columnOrder([
                'default' => 2,
                '@xl' => 1,
                '!@xl' => 1,
            ]),
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->columnOrder([
                'default' => 1,
                '@xl' => 2,
                '!@xl' => 2,
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

In this example, the fallback breakpoints ensure that even in browsers that don't support container queries, the layout will still respond to viewport size changes, with the name field appearing first and the email field second on larger screens.

## Adding extra HTML attributes to a layout component

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the component via the `extraAttributes()` method, which will be merged onto its outer HTML element. The attributes should be represented by an array, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make()
    ->extraAttributes(['class' => 'custom-section-style'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `extraAttributes()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, calling `extraAttributes()` multiple times will overwrite the previous attributes. If you wish to merge the attributes instead, you can pass `merge: true` to the method.

## Introduction

You may want to separate your fields into sections, each with a heading and description. To do this, you can use a section component:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->description('Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per period')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `make()` and `description()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/section/simple" alt="Section" version="4.x" />

You can also use a section without a header, which just wraps the components in a simple card:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/section/without-header" alt="Section without header" version="4.x" />

## Adding an icon to the section's header

You may add an [icon](../styling/icons) to the section's header using the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->icon(Heroicon::ShoppingBag)
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `icon()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/section/icons" alt="Section with icon" version="4.x" />

## Positioning the heading and description aside

You may use the `aside()` to align heading & description on the left, and the components inside a card on the right:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->description('Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per period')
    ->aside()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/section/aside" alt="Section with heading and description aside" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the section should be aside or not:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->description('Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per period')
    ->aside(FeatureFlag::active())
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `aside()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Collapsing sections

Sections may be `collapsible()` to optionally hide long content:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
```

Your sections may be `collapsed()` by default:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsed()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/section/collapsed" alt="Collapsed section" version="4.x" />

Optionally, the `collapsible()` and `collapsed()` methods accept a boolean value to control if the section should be collapsible and collapsed or not:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible(FeatureFlag::active())
    ->collapsed(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `collapsible()` and `collapsed()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Persisting collapsed sections in the user's session

You can persist whether a section is collapsed in local storage using the `persistCollapsed()` method, so it will remain collapsed when the user refreshes the page:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
    ->persistCollapsed()
```

To persist the collapse state, the local storage needs a unique ID to store the state. This ID is generated based on the heading of the section. If your section does not have a heading, or if you have multiple sections with the same heading that you do not want to collapse together, you can manually specify the `id()` of that section to prevent an ID conflict:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
    ->persistCollapsed()
    ->id('order-cart')
```

Optionally, the `persistCollapsed()` method accepts a boolean value to control if the section should persist its collapsed state or not:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
    ->persistCollapsed(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `persistCollapsed()` and `id()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Compact section styling

When nesting sections, you can use a more compact styling:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->description('Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per period')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->compact()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/section/compact" alt="Compact section" version="4.x" />

Optionally, the `compact()` method accepts a boolean value to control if the section should be compact or not:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->description('Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per period')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->compact(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `compact()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Secondary section styling

By default, sections have a contrasting background color, which makes them stand out against a gray background. Secondary styling gives the section a less contrasting background, so it is usually slightly darker. This is a better styling when the background color behind the section is the same color as the default section background color, for example when a section is nested inside another section. Secondary sections can be created using the `secondary()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Notes')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->secondary()
    ->compact()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/section/secondary" alt="Secondary section" version="4.x" />

Optionally, the `secondary()` method accepts a boolean value to control if the section should be secondary or not:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Notes')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->secondary(FeatureFlag::active())
```

## Inserting actions and other components in the header of a section

You may insert [actions](../actions) and any other schema component (usually [prime components](primes)) into the header of a section by passing an array of components to the `afterHeader()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->description('Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per period')
    ->afterHeader([
        Action::make('test'),
    ])
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `afterHeader()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/section/header/actions" alt="Section with actions in the header" version="4.x" />

## Inserting actions and other components in the footer of a section

You may insert [actions](../actions) and any other schema component (usually [prime components](primes)) into the footer of a section by passing an array of components to the `footer()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->description('Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per period')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->footer([
        Action::make('test'),
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `footer()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/section/footer/actions" alt="Section with actions in the footer" version="4.x" />

## Using grid columns within a section

You may use the `columns()` method to easily create a [grid](layouts#grid-system) within the section:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Heading')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2)
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `columns()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Introduction

Some schemas can be long and complex. You may want to use tabs to reduce the number of components that are visible at once:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `make()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/tabs/simple" alt="Tabs" version="4.x" />

## Setting the default active tab

The first tab will be open by default. You can change the default open tab using the `activeTab()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
    ->activeTab(2)
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `activeTab()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Setting a tab icon

Tabs may have an [icon](../styling/icons), which you can set using the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tab::make('Notifications')
            ->icon(Heroicon::Bell)
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `icon()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/tabs/icons" alt="Tabs with icons" version="4.x" />

### Setting the tab icon position

The icon of the tab may be positioned before or after the label using the `iconPosition()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;
use Filament\Support\Enums\IconPosition;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tab::make('Notifications')
            ->icon(Heroicon::Bell)
            ->iconPosition(IconPosition::After)
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `iconPosition()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/tabs/icons-after" alt="Tabs with icons after their labels" version="4.x" />

## Setting a tab badge

Tabs may have a badge, which you can set using the `badge()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tab::make('Notifications')
            ->badge(5)
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `badge()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/tabs/badges" alt="Tabs with badges" version="4.x" />

If you'd like to change the [color](../styling/colors) for a badge, you can use the `badgeColor()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tab::make('Notifications')
            ->badge(5)
            ->badgeColor('info')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `badgeColor()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/tabs/badges-color" alt="Tabs with badges with color" version="4.x" />

## Using grid columns within a tab

You may use the `columns()` method to customize the [grid](layouts#grid-system) within the tab:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ])
            ->columns(3),
        // ...
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `columns()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Using vertical tabs

You can render the tabs vertically by using the `vertical()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
    ->vertical()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/tabs/vertical" alt="Vertical tabs" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you can pass a boolean value to the `vertical()` method to control if the tabs should be rendered vertically or not:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        // ...
    ])
    ->vertical(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `vertical()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Removing the styled container

By default, tabs and their content are wrapped in a container styled as a card. You may remove the styled container using `contained()`:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
    ->contained(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `contained()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Persisting the current tab in the user's session

By default, the current tab is not persisted in the browser's local storage. You can change this behavior using the `persistTab()` method. You must also pass in a unique `id()` for the tabs component, to distinguish it from all other sets of tabs in the app. This ID will be used as the key in the local storage to store the current tab:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        // ...
    ])
    ->persistTab()
    ->id('order-tabs')
```

Optionally, the `persistTab()` method accepts a boolean value to control if the active tab should persist or not:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        // ...
    ])
    ->persistTab(FeatureFlag::active())
    ->id('order-tabs')
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `persistTab()` and `id()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Persisting the current tab in the URL's query string

By default, the current tab is not persisted in the URL's query string. You can change this behavior using the `persistTabInQueryString()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
    ->persistTabInQueryString()
```

When enabled, the current tab is persisted in the URL's query string using the `tab` key. You can change this key by passing it to the `persistTabInQueryString()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Tabs\Tab;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
    ->persistTabInQueryString('settings-tab')
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `persistTabInQueryString()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

Similar to [tabs](tabs), you may want to use a multistep wizard to reduce the number of components that are visible at once. These are especially useful if your form has a definite chronological order, in which you want each step to be validated as the user progresses.

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard\Step;

Wizard::make([
    Step::make('Order')
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]),
    Step::make('Delivery')
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]),
    Step::make('Billing')
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]),
])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/wizard/simple" alt="Wizard" version="4.x" />

<Aside variant="tip">
    We have different setup instructions if you're looking to add a wizard to the creation process inside a [panel resource](../resources/creating-records#using-a-wizard) or an [action modal](../actions/modals#rendering-a-wizard-in-a-modal). Following that documentation will ensure that the ability to submit the form is only available on the last step of the wizard.
</Aside>

## Rendering a submit button on the last step

You may use the `submitAction()` method to render submit button HTML or a view at the end of the wizard, on the last step. This provides a clearer UX than displaying a submit button below the wizard at all times:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->submitAction(view('order-form.submit-button'))

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->submitAction(new HtmlString('<button type="submit">Submit</button>'))
```

Alternatively, you can use the built-in Filament button Blade component:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Blade;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->submitAction(new HtmlString(Blade::render(<<<BLADE
    <x-filament::button
        type="submit"
        size="sm"
    >
        Submit
    </x-filament::button>
BLADE)))
```

You could extract this component to a separate Blade view if you prefer.

## Setting a step icon

Steps may have an [icon](../styling/icons), which you can set using the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard\Step;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

Step::make('Order')
    ->icon(Heroicon::ShoppingBag)
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ]),
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `icon()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/wizard/icons" alt="Wizard with step icons" version="4.x" />

## Customizing the icon for completed steps

You may customize the [icon](#setting-up-step-icons) of a completed step using the `completedIcon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard\Step;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

Step::make('Order')
    ->completedIcon(Heroicon::HandThumbUp)
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ]),
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `completedIcon()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/wizard/completed-icons" alt="Wizard with completed step icons" version="4.x" />

## Adding descriptions to steps

You may add a short description after the title of each step using the `description()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard\Step;

Step::make('Order')
    ->description('Review your basket')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ]),
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `description()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="schemas/layout/wizard/descriptions" alt="Wizard with step descriptions" version="4.x" />

## Setting the default active step

You may use the `startOnStep()` method to load a specific step in the wizard:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->startOnStep(2)
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `startOnStep()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Allowing steps to be skipped

If you'd like to allow free navigation, so all steps are skippable, use the `skippable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->skippable()
```

Optionally, the `skippable()` method accepts a boolean value to control if the step is skippable or not:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard\Step;

Step::make('Order')
    ->skippable(FeatureFlag::active())
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ]),
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `skippable()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Persisting the current step in the URL's query string

By default, the current step is not persisted in the URL's query string. You can change this behavior using the `persistStepInQueryString()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->persistStepInQueryString()
```

When enabled, the current step is persisted in the URL's query string using the `step` key. You can change this key by passing it to the `persistStepInQueryString()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->persistStepInQueryString('wizard-step')
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `persistStepInQueryString()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Step lifecycle hooks

You may use the `afterValidation()` and `beforeValidation()` methods to run code before and after validation occurs on the step:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard\Step;

Step::make('Order')
    ->afterValidation(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->beforeValidation(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ]),
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">You can inject various utilities into the `afterValidation()` and `beforeValidation()` functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Preventing the next step from being loaded

Inside `afterValidation()` or `beforeValidation()`, you may throw `Filament\Support\Exceptions\Halt`, which will prevent the wizard from loading the next step:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard\Step;
use Filament\Support\Exceptions\Halt;

Step::make('Order')
    ->afterValidation(function () {
        // ...

        if (true) {
            throw new Halt();
        }
    })
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ]),
```

## Using grid columns within a step

You may use the `columns()` method to customize the [grid](layouts#grid-system) within the step:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard\Step;

Wizard::make([
    Step::make('Order')
        ->columns(2)
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]),
    // ...
])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `columns()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the wizard action objects

This component uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the `$action` object, which you can use to [customize it](../actions/overview). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

- `nextAction()`
- `previousAction()`

Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Wizard;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])
    ->nextAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Next step'),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Action;;Filament\Actions\Action;;$action;;The action object to customize.">The action registration methods can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

Within Filament schemas, prime components are the most basic building blocks that can be used to insert arbitrary content into a schema, such as text and images. As the name suggests, prime components are not divisible and cannot be made simpler. Filament provides a set of built-in prime components:

- [Text](#text-component)
- [Icon](#icon-component)
- [Image](#image-component)
- [Unordered list](#unordered-list-component)

You may also [create your own custom components](custom-components) to add your own arbitrary content to a schema.

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/overview/example" alt="An example of using prime components to set up two-factor authentication." version="4.x" />

In this example, prime components are being used to display instructions to the user, a QR code that the user can scan, and list of recovery codes that the user can save:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Image;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\UnorderedList;
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Support\Enums\TextSize;

$schema
    ->components([
        Text::make('Scan this QR code with your authenticator app:')
            ->color('neutral'),
        Image::make(
            url: asset('images/qr.jpg'),
            alt: 'QR code to scan with an authenticator app',
        )
            ->imageHeight('12rem')
            ->alignCenter(),
        Section::make()
            ->schema([
                Text::make('Please save the following recovery codes in a safe place. They will only be shown once, but you\'ll need them if you lose access to your authenticator app:')
                    ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
                    ->color('neutral'),
                UnorderedList::make(fn (): array => array_map(
                    fn (string $recoveryCode): Text => Text::make($recoveryCode)
                        ->copyable()
                        ->fontFamily(FontFamily::Mono)
                        ->size(TextSize::ExtraSmall)
                        ->color('neutral'),
                    ['tYRnCqNLUx-3QOLNKyDiV', 'cKok2eImKc-oWHHH4VhNe', 'C0ZstEcSSB-nrbyk2pv8z', '49EXLRQ8MI-FpWywpSDHE', 'TXjHnvkUrr-KuiVJENPmJ', 'BB574ookll-uI20yxP6oa', 'BbgScF2egu-VOfHrMtsCl', 'cO0dJYqmee-S9ubJHpRFR'],
                ))
                    ->size(TextSize::ExtraSmall),
            ])
            ->compact()
            ->secondary(),
    ])
```

Although text can be rendered in a schema using an [infolist text entry](../infolists/text-entry), entries are intended to render a label-value detail about an entity (like an Eloquent model), and not to render arbitrary text. Prime components are more suitable for this purpose. Infolists can be considered more similar to [description lists](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl) in HTML.

Prime component classes can be found in the `Filament\Schemas\Components` namespace. They reside within the schema array of components.

## Text component

Text can be inserted into a schema using the `Text` component. Text content is passed to the `make()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;

Text::make('Modifying these permissions may give users access to sensitive information.')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/text/simple" alt="Text" version="4.x" />

To render raw HTML content, you can pass an `HtmlString` object to the `make()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

Text::make(new HtmlString('<strong>Warning:</strong> Modifying these permissions may give users access to sensitive information.'))
```

<Aside variant="danger">
    Be aware that you will need to ensure that the HTML is safe to render, otherwise your application will be vulnerable to XSS attacks.
</Aside>

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/text/html" alt="Text with HTML" version="4.x" />

To render Markdown, you can use Laravel's `str()` helper to convert Markdown to HTML, and then transform it into an `HtmlString` object:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;

Text::make(
    str('**Warning:** Modifying these permissions may give users access to sensitive information.')
        ->inlineMarkdown()
        ->toHtmlString(),
)
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `make()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing the text color

You may set a [color](../styling/colors) for the text:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;

Text::make('Information')
    ->color('info')
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `color()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/text/color" alt="Text in the info color" version="4.x" />

### Using a neutral color

By default, the text color is set to `gray`, which is typically fairly dim against its background. You can darken it using the `color('neutral')` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;

Text::make('Modifying these permissions may give users access to sensitive information.')

Text::make('Modifying these permissions may give users access to sensitive information.')
    ->color('neutral')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/text/neutral" alt="Text in the neutral color" version="4.x" />

### Displaying as a "badge"

By default, text is quite plain and has no background color. You can make it appear as a "badge" instead using the `badge()` method. A great use case for this is with statuses, where may want to display a badge with a [color](#customizing-the-text-color) that matches the status:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;

Text::make('Warning')
    ->color('warning')
    ->badge()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/text/badge" alt="Text as badge" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should be in a badge or not:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;

Text::make('Warning')
    ->color('warning')
    ->badge(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `badge()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Adding an icon to the badge

You may add other things to the badge, like an [icon](../styling/icons):

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

Text::make('Warning')
    ->color('warning')
    ->badge()
    ->icon(Heroicon::ExclamationTriangle)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/text/badge-icon" alt="Text as badge with an icon" version="4.x" />

### Customizing the text size

Text has a small font size by default, but you may change this to `TextSize::ExtraSmall`, `TextSize::Medium`, or `TextSize::Large`.

For instance, you may make the text larger using `size(TextSize::Large)`:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;
use Filament\Support\Enums\TextSize;

Text::make('Modifying these permissions may give users access to sensitive information.')
    ->size(TextSize::Large)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/text/large" alt="Text entry in a large font size" version="4.x" />

### Customizing the font weight

Text entries have regular font weight by default, but you may change this to any of the following options: `FontWeight::Thin`, `FontWeight::ExtraLight`, `FontWeight::Light`, `FontWeight::Medium`, `FontWeight::SemiBold`, `FontWeight::Bold`, `FontWeight::ExtraBold` or `FontWeight::Black`.

For instance, you may make the font bold using `weight(FontWeight::Bold)`:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;

Text::make('Modifying these permissions may give users access to sensitive information.')
    ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `weight()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/text/bold" alt="Text entry in a bold font" version="4.x" />

### Customizing the font family

You can change the text font family to any of the following options: `FontFamily::Sans`, `FontFamily::Serif` or `FontFamily::Mono`.

For instance, you may make the font monospaced using `fontFamily(FontFamily::Mono)`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontFamily;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;

Text::make('28o.-AK%D~xh*.:[4"3)zPiC')
    ->fontFamily(FontFamily::Mono)
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `fontFamily()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/text/mono" alt="Text entry in a monospaced font" version="4.x" />

### Adding a tooltip to the text

You may add a tooltip to the text using the `tooltip()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;

Text::make('28o.-AK%D~xh*.:[4"3)zPiC')
    ->tooltip('Your secret recovery code')
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `tooltip()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/text/tooltip" alt="Text with a tooltip" version="4.x" />

### Using JavaScript to determine the content of the text

You can use JavaScript to determine the content of the text. This is useful if you want to display a different message depending on the state of a [form field](../forms/fields), without making a request to the server to re-render the schema. To allow this, you can use the `js()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;

Text::make(<<<'JS'
    $get('name') ? `Hello, ${$get('name')}` : 'Please enter your name.'
    JS)
    ->js()
```

The [`$state`](../forms/fields#injecting-the-current-state-of-the-field) and [`$get()`](../forms/fields#injecting-the-state-of-another-field) utilities are available in the JavaScript context, so you can use them to get the state of fields in the schema.

## Icon component

Icons can be inserted into a schema using the `Icon` component. [Icons](../styling/icons) are passed to the `make()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

Icon::make(Heroicon::Star)
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `make()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/icon/simple" alt="Icon" version="4.x" />

### Customizing the icon color

You may set a [color](../styling/colors) for the icon:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

Icon::make(Heroicon::ExclamationCircle)
    ->color('danger')
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `color()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/icon/color" alt="Icon in the danger color" version="4.x" />

### Adding a tooltip to the icon

You may add a tooltip to the icon using the `tooltip()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Icon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

Icon::make(Heroicon::ExclamationTriangle)
    ->tooltip('Warning')
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `tooltip()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/icon/tooltip" alt="Icon with a tooltip" version="4.x" />

## Image component

Images can be inserted into a schema using the `Image` component. The image URL and alt text are passed to the `make()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Image;

Image::make(
    url: asset('images/qr.jpg'),
    alt: 'QR code to scan with an authenticator app',
)
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static values, the arguments of the `make()` method also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/image/simple" alt="Image" version="4.x" />

### Customizing the image size

You may customize the image size by passing a `imageWidth()` and `imageHeight()`, or both with `imageSize()`:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Image;

Image::make(
    url: asset('images/qr.jpg'),
    alt: 'QR code to scan with an authenticator app',
)
    ->imageWidth('12rem')

Image::make(
    url: asset('images/qr.jpg'),
    alt: 'QR code to scan with an authenticator app',
)
    ->imageHeight('12rem')

Image::make(
    url: asset('images/qr.jpg'),
    alt: 'QR code to scan with an authenticator app',
)
    ->imageSize('12rem')
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static values, the `imageWidth()`, `imageHeight()` and `imageSize()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/image/size" alt="Image with a custom size" version="4.x" />

### Aligning the image

You may align the image to the start (left in left-to-right interfaces, right in right-to-left interfaces), center, or end (right in left-to-right interfaces, left in right-to-left interfaces) using the `alignStart()`, `alignCenter()` or `alignEnd()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Image;

Image::make(
    url: asset('images/qr.jpg'),
    alt: 'QR code to scan with an authenticator app',
)
    ->alignStart() // This is the default alignment.

Image::make(
    url: asset('images/qr.jpg'),
    alt: 'QR code to scan with an authenticator app',
)
    ->alignCenter()

Image::make(
    url: asset('images/qr.jpg'),
    alt: 'QR code to scan with an authenticator app',
)
    ->alignEnd()
```

Alternatively, you may pass an `Alignment` enum to the `alignment()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Image;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;

Image::make(
    url: asset('images/qr.jpg'),
    alt: 'QR code to scan with an authenticator app',
)
    ->alignment(Alignment::Center)
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `alignment()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/image/alignment" alt="Image with a custom alignment" version="4.x" />

### Adding a tooltip to the image

You may add a tooltip to the image using the `tooltip()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Image;

Image::make(
    url: asset('images/qr.jpg'),
    alt: 'QR code to scan with an authenticator app',
)
    ->tooltip('Scan this QR code with your authenticator app')
    ->alignCenter()
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `tooltip()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/image/tooltip" alt="Image with a tooltip" version="4.x" />

## Unordered list component

Unordered lists can be inserted into a schema using the `UnorderedList` component. The list items, comprising plain text or [text components](#text-component), are passed to the `make()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\UnorderedList;

UnorderedList::make([
    'Tables',
    'Schemas',
    'Actions',
    'Notifications',
])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `make()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/unordered-list/simple" alt="Unordered list" version="4.x" />

Text components can be used as list items, which allows you to customize the formatting of each item:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\UnorderedList;
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontFamily;

UnorderedList::make([
    Text::make('Tables')->fontFamily(FontFamily::Mono),
    Text::make('Schemas')->fontFamily(FontFamily::Mono),
    Text::make('Actions')->fontFamily(FontFamily::Mono),
    Text::make('Notifications')->fontFamily(FontFamily::Mono),
])
```

### Customizing the bullet size

If you are modifying the text size of the list content, you will probably want to adjust the size of the bullets to match. To do this, you can use the `size()` method. Bullets have small font size by default, but you may change this to `TextSize::ExtraSmall`, `TextSize::Medium`, or `TextSize::Large`.

For instance, you may make the bullets larger using `size(TextSize::Large)`:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\UnorderedList;

UnorderedList::make([
    Text::make('Tables')->size(TextSize::Large),
    Text::make('Schemas')->size(TextSize::Large),
    Text::make('Actions')->size(TextSize::Large),
    Text::make('Notifications')->size(TextSize::Large),
])
    ->size(TextSize::Large)
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `size()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="primes/unordered-list/large" alt="Unordered list with large bullets" version="4.x" />

## Adding extra HTML attributes to a prime component

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the component via the `extraAttributes()` method, which will be merged onto its outer HTML element. The attributes should be represented by an array, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Text;

Text::make('Modifying these permissions may give users access to sensitive information.')
    ->extraAttributes(['class' => 'custom-text-style'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `extraAttributes()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, calling `extraAttributes()` multiple times will overwrite the previous attributes. If you wish to merge the attributes instead, you can pass `merge: true` to the method.

## Inserting a Blade view into a schema

You may use a "view" component to insert a Blade view into a schema arbitrarily:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\View;

View::make('filament.schemas.components.chart')
```

This assumes that you have a `resources/views/filament/schemas/components/chart.blade.php` file.

### Rendering the component's child schema

You may pass an array of child schema components to the `schema()` method of the component:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\View;

View::make('filament.schemas.components.chart')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('subtotal'),
        TextInput::make('total'),
    ])
```

Inside the Blade view, you may render the component's `schema()` using the `$getChildSchema()` function:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $getChildSchema() }}
</div>
```

### Accessing the state of another component in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the state of another component in the schema using the `$get()` function:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $get('email') }}
</div>
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    Unless a form field is [reactive](../forms/overview#the-basics-of-reactivity), the Blade view will not refresh when the value of the field changes, only when the next user interaction occurs that makes a request to the server. If you need to react to changes in a field's value, it should be `live()`.
</Aside>

### Accessing the Eloquent record in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the current Eloquent record using the `$record` variable:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $record->name }}
</div>
```

### Accessing the current operation in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the current operation, usually `create`, `edit` or `view`, using the `$operation` variable:

```blade
<p>
    @if ($operation === 'create')
        This is a new post.
    @else
        This is an existing post.
    @endif
</p>
```

### Accessing the current Livewire component instance in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the current Livewire component instance using `$this`:

```blade
@php
    use Filament\Resources\Users\RelationManagers\PostsRelationManager;
@endphp

<p>
    @if ($this instanceof PostsRelationManager)
        You are editing posts the of a user.
    @endif
</p>
```

### Accessing the current component instance in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the current component instance using `$schemaComponent`. You can call public methods on this object to access other information that may not be available in variables:

```blade
<p>
    @if ($schemaComponent->getState())
        This is a new post.
    @endif
</p>
```

## Inserting a Livewire component into a schema

You may insert a Livewire component directly into a schema:

```php
use App\Livewire\Chart;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Livewire;

Livewire::make(Chart::class)
```

<Aside variant="info">
    When inserting a Livewire component into the schema, there are limited capabilities. Only serializable data is accessible from the nested Livewire component, since they are rendered separately. As such, you can't [render a child schema](#rendering-the-components-child-schema), [access another component's live state](#accessing-the-state-of-another-component-in-the-blade-view), [access the current Livewire component instance](#accessing-the-current-livewire-component-instance-in-the-blade-view), or [access the current component instance](#accessing-the-current-component-instance-in-the-blade-view). Only [static data that you pass to the Livewire component](#passing-parameters-to-a-livewire-component), and [the current record](#accessing-the-current-record-in-the-livewire-component) are accessible. Situations where you should render a nested Livewire component instead of a [Blade view](#inserting-a-blade-view-into-a-schema) are rare because of these limitations.
</Aside>

If you are rendering multiple of the same Livewire component, please make sure to pass a unique `key()` to each:

```php
use App\Livewire\Chart;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Livewire;

Livewire::make(Chart::class)
    ->key('chart-first')

Livewire::make(Chart::class)
    ->key('chart-second')

Livewire::make(Chart::class)
    ->key('chart-third')
```

### Passing parameters to a Livewire component

You can pass an array of parameters to a Livewire component:

```php
use App\Livewire\Chart;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Livewire;

Livewire::make(Chart::class, ['bar' => 'baz'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="schemaComponents" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `make()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

Now, those parameters will be passed to the Livewire component's `mount()` method:

```php
class Chart extends Component
{
    public function mount(string $bar): void
    {       
        // ...
    }
}
```

Alternatively, they will be available as public properties on the Livewire component:

```php
class Chart extends Component
{
    public string $bar;
}
```

#### Accessing the current record in the Livewire component

You can access the current record in the Livewire component using the `$record` parameter in the `mount()` method, or the `$record` property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Chart extends Component
{
    public function mount(?Model $record = null): void
    {       
        // ...
    }
    
    // or
    
    public ?Model $record = null;
}
```

Please be aware that when the record has not yet been created, it will be `null`. If you'd like to hide the Livewire component when the record is `null`, you can use the `hidden()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Livewire;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

Livewire::make(Chart::class)
    ->hidden(fn (?Model $record): bool => $record === null)
```

### Lazy loading a Livewire component

You may allow the component to [lazily load](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/lazy#rendering-placeholder-html) using the `lazy()` method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Livewire;
use App\Livewire\Chart;

Livewire::make(Chart::class)
    ->lazy()       
```

## Custom component classes

You may create your own custom component classes and views, which you can reuse across your project, and even release as a plugin to the community.

<Aside variant="tip">
    If you're just creating a simple custom component to use once, you could instead use a [view component](#inserting-a-blade-view-into-a-schema) to render any custom Blade file.
</Aside>

To create a custom component class and view, you may use the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-schema-component Chart
```

This will create the following component class:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Component;

class Chart extends Component
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.schemas.components.chart';

    public static function make(): static
    {
        return app(static::class);
    }
}
```

It will also create a view file at `resources/views/filament/schemas/components/chart.blade.php`.

You may use the same utilities as you would when [inserting a Blade view into a schema](#inserting-a-blade-view-into-a-schema) to [render the component's child schema](#rendering-the-components-child-schema), [access another component's live state](#accessing-the-state-of-another-component-in-the-blade-view), [access the current Eloquent record](#accessing-the-eloquent-record-in-the-blade-view), [access the current operation](#accessing-the-current-operation-in-the-blade-view), [access the current Livewire component instance](#accessing-the-current-livewire-component-instance-in-the-blade-view), and [access the current component instance](#accessing-the-current-component-instance-in-the-blade-view).

<Aside variant="info">
    Filament schema components are **not** Livewire components. Defining public properties and methods on a schema component class will not make them accessible in the Blade view.
</Aside>

### Adding a configuration method to a custom component class

You may add a public method to the custom component class that accepts a configuration value, stores it in a protected property, and returns it again from another public method:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Component;

class Chart extends Component
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.schemas.components.chart';
    
    protected ?string $heading = null;

    public static function make(): static
    {
        return app(static::class);
    }

    public function heading(?string $heading): static
    {
        $this->heading = $heading;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getHeading(): ?string
    {
        return $this->heading;
    }
}
```

Now, in the Blade view for the custom component, you may access the heading using the `$getHeading()` function:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $getHeading() }}
</div>
```

Any public method that you define on the custom component class can be accessed in the Blade view as a variable function in this way.

To pass the configuration value to the custom component class, you may use the public method:

```php
use App\Filament\Schemas\Components\Chart;

Chart::make()
    ->heading('Sales')
```

#### Allowing utility injection in a custom component configuration method

[Utility injection](overview#component-utility-injection) is a powerful feature of Filament that allows users to configure a component using functions that can access various utilities. You can allow utility injection by ensuring that the parameter type and property type of the configuration allows the user to pass a `Closure`. In the getter method, you should pass the configuration value to the `$this->evaluate()` method, which will inject utilities into the user's function if they pass one, or return the value if it is static:

```php
use Closure;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Component;

class Chart extends Component
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.schemas.components.chart';
    
    protected string | Closure | null $heading = null;

    public static function make(): static
    {
        return app(static::class);
    }

    public function heading(string | Closure | null $heading): static
    {
        $this->heading = $heading;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getHeading(): ?string
    {
        return $this->evaluate($this->heading);
    }
}
```

Now, you can pass a static value or a function to the `heading()` method, and [inject any utility](overview#component-utility-injection) as a parameter:

```php
use App\Filament\Schemas\Components\Chart;

Chart::make()
    ->heading(fn (Product $record): string => "{$record->name} Sales")
```

### Accepting a configuration value in the constructor of a custom component class

You may accept a configuration value in the `make()` constructor method of the custom component and pass it to the corresponding setter method:

```php
use Closure;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Component;

class Chart extends Component
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.schemas.components.chart';
    
    protected string | Closure | null $heading = null;

    public function __construct(string | Closure | null $heading = null)
    {
        $this->heading($heading)
    }

    public static function make(string | Closure | null $heading = null): static
    {
        return app(static::class, ['heading' => $heading]);
    }
    
    public function heading(string | Closure | null $heading): static
    {
        $this->heading = $heading;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getHeading(): ?string
    {
        return $this->evaluate($this->heading);
    }
}
```

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Introduction

Tables are a common UI pattern for displaying lists of records in web applications. Filament provides a PHP-based API for defining tables with many features, while also being incredibly customizable.

### Defining table columns

The basis of any table is rows and columns. Filament uses Eloquent to get the data for rows in the table, and you are responsible for defining the columns that are used in that row.

Filament includes many column types prebuilt for you, and you can [view a full list here](columns/overview). You can even [create your own custom column types](columns/custom-columns) to display data in whatever way you need.

Columns are stored in an array, as objects within the `$table->columns()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('slug'),
            IconColumn::make('is_featured')
                ->boolean(),
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/overview/columns" alt="Table with columns" version="4.x" />

In this example, there are 3 columns in the table. The first two display [text](columns/text) - the title and slug of each row in the table. The third column displays an [icon](columns/icon), either a green check or a red cross depending on if the row is featured or not.

#### Making columns sortable and searchable

You can easily modify columns by chaining methods onto them. For example, you can make a column [searchable](columns/overview#searching) using the `searchable()` method. Now, there will be a search field in the table, and you will be able to filter rows by the value of that column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->searchable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/overview/searchable-columns" alt="Table with searchable column" version="4.x" />

You can make multiple columns searchable, and Filament will be able to search for matches within any of them, all at once.

You can also make a column [sortable](columns/overview#sorting) using the `sortable()` method. This will add a sort button to the column header, and clicking it will sort the table by that column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->sortable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/overview/sortable-columns" alt="Table with sortable column" version="4.x" />

#### Accessing related data from columns

You can also display data in a column that belongs to a relationship. For example, if you have a `Post` model that belongs to a `User` model (the author of the post), you can display the user's name in the table:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('author.name')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/overview/relationship-columns" alt="Table with relationship column" version="4.x" />

In this case, Filament will search for an `author` relationship on the `Post` model, and then display the `name` attribute of that relationship. We call this "dot notation", and you can use it to display any attribute of any relationship, even nested relationships. Filament uses this dot notation to eager-load the results of that relationship for you.

For more information about column relationships, visit the [Relationships section](columns/overview#displaying-data-from-relationships).

#### Adding new columns alongside existing columns

While the `columns()` method redefines all columns for a table, you may sometimes want to add columns to an existing configuration without overriding it completely. This is particularly useful when you have global column configurations that should appear across multiple tables.

Filament provides the `pushColumns()` method for this purpose. Unlike `columns()`, which replaces the entire column configuration, `pushColumns()` appends new columns to any existing ones.

This is especially powerful when combined with [global table settings](#global-settings) in the `boot()` method of a service provider, such as `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

Table::configureUsing(function (Table $table) {
    $table
        ->pushColumns([
            TextColumn::make('created_at')
                ->label('Created')
                ->sortable()
                ->toggleable(isToggledHiddenByDefault: true),

            TextColumn::make('updated_at')
                ->label('Updated')
                ->sortable()
                ->toggleable(isToggledHiddenByDefault: true),
        ]);
});
```

### Defining table filters

As well as making columns `searchable()`, which allows the user to filter the table by searching the content of columns, you can also allow the users to filter rows in the table in other ways. [Filters](filters) can be defined in the `$table->filters()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filters([
            Filter::make('is_featured')
                ->query(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_featured', true)),
            SelectFilter::make('status')
                ->options([
                    'draft' => 'Draft',
                    'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
                    'published' => 'Published',
                ]),
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/overview/filters" alt="Table with filters" version="4.x" />

In this example, we have defined 2 table filters. On the table, there is now a "filter" icon button in the top corner. Clicking it will open a dropdown with the 2 filters we have defined.

The first filter is rendered as a checkbox. When it's checked, only featured rows in the table will be displayed. When it's unchecked, all rows will be displayed.

The second filter is rendered as a select dropdown. When a user selects an option, only rows with that status will be displayed. When no option is selected, all rows will be displayed.

You can use any [schema component](../schemas) to build the UI for a filter. For example, you could create [a custom date range filter](filters/custom).

### Defining table actions

Filament's tables can use [actions](../actions/overview). They are buttons that can be added to the [end of any table row](actions#record-actions), or even in the [header](actions#header-actions) of a table. For instance, you may want an action to "create" a new record in the header, and then "edit" and "delete" actions on each row. [Bulk actions](actions#bulk-actions) can be used to execute code when records in the table are selected.

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Actions\BulkActionGroup;
use Filament\Actions\DeleteBulkAction;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            Action::make('feature')
                ->action(function (Post $record) {
                    $record->is_featured = true;
                    $record->save();
                })
                ->hidden(fn (Post $record): bool => $record->is_featured),
            Action::make('unfeature')
                ->action(function (Post $record) {
                    $record->is_featured = false;
                    $record->save();
                })
                ->visible(fn (Post $record): bool => $record->is_featured),
        ])
        ->toolbarActions([
            BulkActionGroup::make([
                DeleteBulkAction::make(),
            ]),
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/overview/actions" alt="Table with actions" version="4.x" />

In this example, we define 2 actions for table rows. The first action is a "feature" action. When clicked, it will set the `is_featured` attribute on the record to `true` - which is written within the `action()` method. Using the `hidden()` method, the action will be hidden if the record is already featured. The second action is an "unfeature" action. When clicked, it will set the `is_featured` attribute on the record to `false`. Using the `visible()` method, the action will be hidden if the record is not featured.

We also define a bulk action. When bulk actions are defined, each row in the table will have a checkbox. This bulk action is [built-in to Filament](../actions/delete#bulk-delete), and it will delete all selected records. However, you can [write your own custom bulk actions](actions#bulk-actions) easily too.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/overview/actions-modal" alt="Table with action modal open" version="4.x" />

Actions can also open modals to request confirmation from the user, as well as render forms inside to collect extra data. It's a good idea to read the [Actions documentation](../actions) to learn more about their extensive capabilities throughout Filament.

## Pagination

By default, Filament tables will be paginated. The user can choose between 5, 10, 25, and 50 records per page. If there are more records than the selected number, the user can navigate between pages using the pagination buttons.

### Customizing the pagination options

You may customize the options for the paginated records per page select by passing them to the `paginated()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->paginated([10, 25, 50, 100, 'all']);
}
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    Be aware when using very high numbers and `all` as large number of records can cause performance issues.
</Aside>

### Customizing the default pagination page option

To customize the default number of records shown use the `defaultPaginationPageOption()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->defaultPaginationPageOption(25);
}
```

<Aside variant="info">
    Make sure that the default pagination page option is included in the [pagination options](#customizing-the-pagination-options).
</Aside>

### Displaying links to the first and the last pagination page

To add "extreme" links to the first and the last page using the `extremePaginationLinks()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->extremePaginationLinks();
}
```

### Using simple pagination

You may use simple pagination by using the `paginationMode(PaginationMode::Simple)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\PaginationMode;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->paginationMode(PaginationMode::Simple);
}
```

### Using cursor pagination

You may use cursor pagination by using the `paginationMode(PaginationMode::Cursor)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\PaginationMode;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->paginationMode(PaginationMode::Cursor);
}
```

### Preventing query string conflicts with the pagination page

By default, Livewire stores the pagination state in a `page` parameter of the URL query string. If you have multiple tables on the same page, this will mean that the pagination state of one table may be overwritten by the state of another table.

To fix this, you may define a `$table->queryStringIdentifier()`, to return a unique query string identifier for that table:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->queryStringIdentifier('users');
}
```

### Disabling pagination

By default, tables will be paginated. To disable this, you should use the `$table->paginated(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->paginated(false);
}
```

## Record URLs (clickable rows)

You may allow table rows to be completely clickable by using the `$table->recordUrl()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->recordUrl(
            fn (Model $record): string => route('posts.edit', ['record' => $record]),
        );
}
```

When using a [resource](../resources) table, the URL for each row is usually already set up for you, but this method can be called to override the default URL for each row.

<Aside variant="tip">
    You can also [override the URL](columns/overview#opening-urls) for a specific column, or [trigger an action](columns/overview#triggering-actions) when a column is clicked.
</Aside>

You may also open the URL in a new tab:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->openRecordUrlInNewTab();
}
```

## Reordering records

To allow the user to reorder records using drag and drop in your table, you can use the `$table->reorderable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->reorderable('sort');
}
```

If you're using mass assignment protection on your model, you will also need to add the `sort` attribute to the `$fillable` array there.

When making the table reorderable, a new button will be available on the table to toggle reordering.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/reordering" alt="Table with reorderable rows" version="4.x" />

The `reorderable()` method accepts the name of a column to store the record order in. If you use something like [`spatie/eloquent-sortable`](https://github.com/spatie/eloquent-sortable) with an order column such as `order_column`, you may use this instead:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->reorderable('order_column');
}
```

The `reorderable()` method also accepts a boolean condition as its second parameter, allowing you to conditionally enable reordering:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->reorderable('sort', auth()->user()->isAdmin());
}
```

You can pass a `direction` parameter as `desc` to reorder the records in descending order instead of ascending:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->reorderable('sort', direction: 'desc');
}
```

### Enabling pagination while reordering

Pagination will be disabled in reorder mode to allow you to move records between pages. It is generally a bad experience to have pagination while reordering, but if would like to override this use `$table->paginatedWhileReordering()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->paginatedWhileReordering();
}
```

### Customizing the reordering trigger action

To customize the reordering trigger button, you may use the `reorderRecordsTriggerAction()` method, passing a closure that returns an action. All methods that are available to [customize action trigger buttons](../actions/overview) can be used:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->reorderRecordsTriggerAction(
            fn (Action $action, bool $isReordering) => $action
                ->button()
                ->label($isReordering ? 'Disable reordering' : 'Enable reordering'),
        );
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/reordering/custom-trigger-action" alt="Table with reorderable rows and a custom trigger action" version="4.x" />

## Customizing the table header

You can add a heading to a table using the `$table->heading()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->heading('Clients')
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ]);
```

You can also add a description below the heading using the `$table->description()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->heading('Clients')
        ->description('Manage your clients here.')
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ]);
```

You can pass a view to the `$table->header()` method to customize the entire header HTML:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->header(view('tables.header', [
            'heading' => 'Clients',
        ]))
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ]);
```

## Polling table content

You may poll table content so that it refreshes at a set interval, using the `$table->poll()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->poll('10s');
}
```

## Deferring loading

Tables with lots of data might take a while to load, in which case you can load the table data asynchronously using the `deferLoading()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->deferLoading();
}
```

## Searching records with Laravel Scout

While Filament doesn't provide a direct integration with [Laravel Scout](https://laravel.com/docs/scout), you may use the `searchUsing()` method with a `whereKey()` clause to filter the query for Scout results:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->searchUsing(fn (Builder $query, string $search) => $query->whereKey(Post::search($search)->keys()));
```

Under normal circumstances Scout uses the `whereKey()` (`whereIn()`) method to retrieve results internally, so there is no performance penalty for using it.

For the global search input to show, at least one column in the table needs to be `searchable()`. Alternatively, if you are using Scout to control which columns are searchable already, you can simply pass `searchable()` to the entire table instead:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->searchable();
}
```

## Styling table rows

### Striped table rows

To enable striped table rows, you can use the `striped()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->striped();
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/striped" alt="Table with striped rows" version="4.x" />

### Custom row classes

You may want to conditionally style rows based on the record data. This can be achieved by specifying a string or array of CSS classes to be applied to the row using the `$table->recordClasses()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Closure;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->recordClasses(fn (Post $record) => match ($record->status) {
            'draft' => 'draft-post-table-row',
            'reviewing' => 'reviewing-post-table-row',
            'published' => 'published-post-table-row',
            default => null,
        });
}
```

## Global settings

To customize the default configuration used for all tables, you can call the static `configureUsing()` method from the `boot()` method of a service provider. The function will be run for each table that gets created:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\FiltersLayout;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

Table::configureUsing(function (Table $table): void {
    $table
        ->reorderableColumns()
        ->filtersLayout(FiltersLayout::AboveContentCollapsible)
        ->paginationPageOptions([10, 25, 50]);
});
```

## Introduction

Column classes can be found in the `Filament\Tables\Columns` namespace. They reside within the `$table->columns()` method. Filament includes a number of columns built-in:

- [Text column](text)
- [Icon column](icon)
- [Image column](image)
- [Color column](color)

Editable columns allow the user to update data in the database without leaving the table:

- [Select column](select)
- [Toggle column](toggle)
- [Text input column](text-input)
- [Checkbox column](checkbox)

You may also [create your own custom columns](custom-columns) to display data however you wish.

Columns may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its unique name. Usually, the name of a column corresponds to the name of an attribute on an Eloquent model. You may use "dot notation" to access attributes within relationships:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')

TextColumn::make('author.name')
```

## Column content (state)

Columns may feel a bit magic at first, but they’re designed to be simple to use and optimized to display data from an Eloquent record. Despite this, they’re flexible and you can display data from any source, not just an Eloquent record attribute.

The data that a column displays is called its "state". When using a [panel resource](../resources), the table is aware of the records it is displaying. This means that the state of the column is set based on the value of the attribute on the record. For example, if the column is used in the table of a `PostResource`, then the `title` attribute value of the current post will be displayed.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Components\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
```

If you want to access the value stored in a relationship, you can use "dot notation". The name of the relationship that you would like to access data from comes first, followed by a dot, and then the name of the attribute:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Components\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('author.name')
```

You can also use "dot notation" to access values within a JSON / array column on an Eloquent model. The name of the attribute comes first, followed by a dot, and then the key of the JSON object you want to read from:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Components\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('meta.title')
```

### Setting the state of a column

You can pass your own state to a column by using the `state()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Components\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->state('Hello, world!')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">The `state()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the state. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Setting the default state of a column

When a column is empty (its state is `null`), you can use the `default()` method to define alternative state to use instead. This method will treat the default state as if it were real, so columns like [image](image) or [color](color) will display the default image or color.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Components\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->default('Untitled')
```

#### Adding placeholder text if a column is empty

Sometimes you may want to display placeholder text for columns with an empty state, which is styled as a lighter gray text. This differs from the [default value](#setting-the-default-state-of-an-column), as the placeholder is always text and not treated as if it were real state.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Components\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->placeholder('Untitled')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/placeholder" alt="Column with a placeholder for empty state" version="4.x" />

### Displaying data from relationships

You may use "dot notation" to access columns within relationships. The name of the relationship comes first, followed by a period, followed by the name of the column to display:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('author.name')
```

#### Counting relationships

If you wish to count the number of related records in a column, you may use the `counts()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('users_count')->counts('users')
```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship to count from. The name of the column must be `users_count`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#counting-related-models) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextColumn::make('users_count')->counts([
    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
])
```

#### Determining relationship existence

If you simply wish to indicate whether related records exist in a column, you may use the `exists()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('users_exists')->exists('users')
```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship to check for existence. The name of the column must be `users_exists`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#other-aggregate-functions) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextColumn::make('users_exists')->exists([
    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
])
```

#### Aggregating relationships

Filament provides several methods for aggregating a relationship field, including `avg()`, `max()`, `min()` and `sum()`. For instance, if you wish to show the average of a field on all related records in a column, you may use the `avg()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('users_avg_age')->avg('users', 'age')
```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship, while `age` is the field that is being averaged. The name of the column must be `users_avg_age`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#other-aggregate-functions) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextColumn::make('users_avg_age')->avg([
    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
], 'age')
```

## Setting a column's label

By default, the label of the column, which is displayed in the header of the table, is generated from the name of the column. You may customize this using the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Components\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->label('Full name')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `label()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

Customizing the label in this way is useful if you wish to use a [translation string for localization](https://laravel.com/docs/localization#retrieving-translation-strings):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Components\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->label(__('columns.name'))
```

## Sorting

Columns may be sortable, by clicking on the column label. To make a column sortable, you must use the `sortable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->sortable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/sortable" alt="Table with sortable column" version="4.x" />

Using the name of the column, Filament will apply an `orderBy()` clause to the Eloquent query. This is useful for simple cases where the column name matches the database column name. It can also handle [relationships](#displaying-data-from-relationships).

However, many columns are not as simple. The [state](#column-content-state) of the column might be customized, or using an [Eloquent accessor](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#accessors-and-mutators). In this case, you may need to customize the sorting behavior.

You can pass an array of real database columns in the table to sort the column with:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->sortable(['first_name', 'last_name'])
```

In this instance, the `full_name` column is not a real column in the database, but the `first_name` and `last_name` columns are. When the `full_name` column is sorted, Filament will sort the table by the `first_name` and `last_name` columns. The reason why two columns are passed is that if two records have the same `first_name`, the `last_name` will be used to sort them. If your use case doesn’t require this, you can pass only one column in the array if you wish.

You may also directly interact with the Eloquent query to customize how sorting is applied for that column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->sortable(query: function (Builder $query, string $direction): Builder {
        return $query
            ->orderBy('last_name', $direction)
            ->orderBy('first_name', $direction);
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x" extras="Direction;;string;;$direction;;The direction that the column is currently being sorted on, either <code>'asc'</code> or <code>'desc'</code>.||Eloquent query builder;;Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;;$query;;The query builder to modify.">The `query` parameter's function can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Sorting by default

You may choose to sort a table by default if no other sort is applied. You can use the `defaultSort()` method for this:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->defaultSort('stock', direction: 'desc');
}
```

The second parameter is optional and defaults to `'asc'`.

If you pass the name of a table column as the first parameter, Filament will use that column's sorting behavior (custom sorting columns or query function). However, if you need to sort by a column that doesn’t exist in the table or in the database, you should pass a query function instead:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->defaultSort(query: function (Builder $query): Builder {
            return $query->orderBy('stock');
        });
}
```

### Persisting the sort in the user's session

To persist the sorting in the user's session, use the `persistSortInSession()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->persistSortInSession();
}
```

### Setting a default sort option label

To set a default sort option label, use the `defaultSortOptionLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->defaultSortOptionLabel('Date');
}
```

## Disabling default primary key sorting

By default, Filament will automatically add a primary key sort to the table query to ensure that the order of records is consistent. If your table doesn't have a primary key, or you wish to disable this behavior, you can use the `defaultKeySort(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->defaultKeySort(false);
}
```

## Searching

Columns may be searchable by using the text input field in the top right of the table. To make a column searchable, you must use the `searchable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->searchable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/searchable" alt="Table with searchable column" version="4.x" />

By default, Filament will apply a `where` clause to the Eloquent query, searching for the column name. This is useful for simple cases where the column name matches the database column name. It can also handle [relationships](#displaying-data-from-relationships).

However, many columns are not as simple. The [state](#column-content-state) of the column might be customized, or using an [Eloquent accessor](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#accessors-and-mutators). In this case, you may need to customize the search behavior.

You can pass an array of real database columns in the table to search the column with:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->searchable(['first_name', 'last_name'])
```

In this instance, the `full_name` column is not a real column in the database, but the `first_name` and `last_name` columns are. When the `full_name` column is searched, Filament will search the table by the `first_name` and `last_name` columns.

You may also directly interact with the Eloquent query to customize how searching is applied for that column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->searchable(query: function (Builder $query, string $search): Builder {
        return $query
            ->where('first_name', 'like', "%{$search}%")
            ->orWhere('last_name', 'like', "%{$search}%");
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x" extras="Search;;string;;$search;;The current search input value.||Eloquent query builder;;Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;;$query;;The query builder to modify.">The `query` parameter's function can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Adding extra searchable columns to the table

You may allow the table to search with extra columns that aren’t present in the table by passing an array of column names to the `searchable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->searchable(['id']);
}
```

You may use dot notation to search within relationships:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->searchable(['id', 'author.id']);
}
```

You may also pass custom functions to search using:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->searchable([
            'id',
            'author.id',
            function (Builder $query, string $search): Builder {
                if (! is_numeric($search)) {
                    return $query;
                }
            
                return $query->whereYear('published_at', $search);
            },
        ]);
}
```

### Customizing the table search field placeholder

You may customize the placeholder in the search field using the `searchPlaceholder()` method on the `$table`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->searchPlaceholder('Search (ID, Name)');
}
```

### Searching individually

You can choose to enable a per-column search input field using the `isIndividual` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->searchable(isIndividual: true)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/individually-searchable" alt="Table with individually searchable column" version="4.x" />

If you use the `isIndividual` parameter, you may still search that column using the main "global" search input field for the entire table.

To disable that functionality while still preserving the individual search functionality, you need the `isGlobal` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->searchable(isIndividual: true, isGlobal: false)
```

### Customizing the table search debounce

You may customize the debounce time in all table search fields using the `searchDebounce()` method on the `$table`. By default, it is set to `500ms`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->searchDebounce('750ms');
}
```

### Searching when the input is blurred

Instead of automatically reloading the table contents while the user is typing their search, which is affected by the [debounce](#customizing-the-table-search-debounce) of the search field, you may change the behavior so that the table is only searched when the user blurs the input (tabs or clicks out of it), using the `searchOnBlur()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->searchOnBlur();
}
```

### Persisting the search in the user's session

To persist the table or individual column search in the user's session, use the `persistSearchInSession()` or `persistColumnSearchInSession()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->persistSearchInSession()
        ->persistColumnSearchesInSession();
}
```

### Disabling search term splitting

By default, the table search will split the search term into individual words and search for each word separately. This allows for more flexible search queries. However, it can have a negative impact on performance when large datasets are involved. You can disable this behavior using the `splitSearchTerms(false)` method on the table:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->splitSearchTerms(false);
}
```

## Clickable cell content

When a cell is clicked, you may open a URL or trigger an "action".

### Opening URLs

To open a URL, you may use the `url()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $record]))
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">The `url()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<Aside variant="tip">
    You can also pick a URL for the entire row to open, not just a singular column. Please see the [Record URLs section](../overview#record-urls-clickable-rows).

    When using a record URL and a column URL, the column URL will override the record URL for those cells only.
</Aside>

You may also choose to open the URL in a new tab:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $record]))
    ->openUrlInNewTab()
```

### Triggering actions

To run a function when a cell is clicked, you may use the `action()` method. Each method accepts a `$record` parameter which you may use to customize the behavior of the action:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->action(function (Post $record): void {
        $this->dispatch('open-post-edit-modal', post: $record->getKey());
    })
```

#### Action modals

You may open [action modals](../../actions#modals) by passing in an `Action` object to the `action()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->action(
        Action::make('select')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(function (Post $record): void {
                $this->dispatch('select-post', post: $record->getKey());
            }),
    )
```

Action objects passed into the `action()` method must have a unique name to distinguish it from other actions within the table.

#### Preventing cells from being clicked

You may prevent a cell from being clicked by using the `disabledClick()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->disabledClick()
```

If [row URLs](../overview#record-urls-clickable-rows) are enabled, the cell will not be clickable.

## Adding a tooltip to a column

You may specify a tooltip to display when you hover over a cell:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->tooltip('Title')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `tooltip()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/tooltips" alt="Table with column triggering a tooltip" version="4.x" />

## Aligning column content

### Horizontally aligning column content

You may align the content of an column to the start (left in left-to-right interfaces, right in right-to-left interfaces), center, or end (right in left-to-right interfaces, left in right-to-left interfaces) using the `alignStart()`, `alignCenter()` or `alignEnd()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->alignStart() // This is the default alignment.

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->alignCenter()

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->alignEnd()
```

Alternatively, you may pass an `Alignment` enum to the `alignment()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->label('Email address')
    ->alignment(Alignment::End)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `alignment()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/alignment" alt="Table with column aligned to the end" version="4.x" />

### Vertically aligning column content

You may align the content of a column to the start, center, or end using the `verticallyAlignStart()`, `verticallyAlignCenter()` or `verticallyAlignEnd()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->verticallyAlignStart()

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->verticallyAlignCenter() // This is the default alignment.

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->verticallyAlignEnd()
```

Alternatively, you may pass a `VerticalAlignment` enum to the `verticalAlignment()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\VerticalAlignment;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->verticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment::Start)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `verticalAlignment()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/vertical-alignment" alt="Table with column vertically aligned to the start" version="4.x" />

## Allowing column headers to wrap

By default, column headers will not wrap onto multiple lines if they need more space. You may allow them to wrap using the `wrapHeader()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->wrapHeader()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the header should wrap:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->wrapHeader(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">The `wrapHeader()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Controlling the width of columns

By default, columns will take up as much space as they need. You may allow some columns to consume more space than others by using the `grow()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->grow()
```

Alternatively, you can define a width for the column, which is passed to the header cell using the `style` attribute, so you can use any valid CSS value:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;

IconColumn::make('is_paid')
    ->label('Paid')
    ->boolean()
    ->width('1%')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">The `width()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the value. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Grouping columns

You group multiple columns together underneath a single heading using a `ColumnGroup` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ColumnGroup;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('slug'),
            ColumnGroup::make('Visibility', [
                TextColumn::make('status'),
                IconColumn::make('is_featured'),
            ]),
            TextColumn::make('author.name'),
        ]);
}
```

The first argument is the label of the group, and the second is an array of column objects that belong to that group.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/grouping" alt="Table with grouped columns" version="4.x" />

You can also control the group header [alignment](#horizontally-aligning-column-content) and [wrapping](#allowing-column-headers-to-wrap) on the `ColumnGroup` object. To improve the multi-line fluency of the API, you can chain the `columns()` onto the object instead of passing it as the second argument:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ColumnGroup;

ColumnGroup::make('Website visibility')
    ->columns([
        // ...
    ])
    ->alignCenter()
    ->wrapHeader()
```

## Hiding columns

You may hide a column by using the `hidden()` or `visible()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->hidden()

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->visible()
```

To hide a column conditionally, you may pass a boolean value to either method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('role')
    ->hidden(FeatureFlag::active())

TextColumn::make('role')
    ->visible(FeatureFlag::active())
```

### Allowing users to manage columns

#### Toggling column visibility

Users may hide or show columns themselves in the table. To make a column toggleable, use the `toggleable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->toggleable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/column-manager" alt="Table with column manager" version="4.x" />

##### Making toggleable columns hidden by default

By default, toggleable columns are visible. To make them hidden instead:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('id')
    ->toggleable(isToggledHiddenByDefault: true)
```

#### Reordering columns

You may allow columns to be reordered in the table using the `reorderableColumns()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->reorderableColumns();
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/column-manager-reorderable" alt="Table with reorderable column manager" version="4.x" />

#### Live column manager

By default, column manager changes (toggling and reordering columns) are deferred and do not affect the table, until the user clicks an "Apply" button. To disable this and make the filters "live" instead, use the `deferColumnManager(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->reorderableColumns()
        ->deferColumnManager(false);
}
```

#### Customizing the column manager dropdown trigger action

To customize the column manager dropdown trigger button, you may use the `columnManagerTriggerAction()` method, passing a closure that returns an action. All methods that are available to [customize action trigger buttons](../actions/overview) can be used:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->columnManagerTriggerAction(
            fn (Action $action) => $action
                ->button()
                ->label('Column Manager'),
        );
}
```

## Adding extra HTML attributes to a column content

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the column content via the `extraAttributes()` method, which will be merged onto its outer HTML element. The attributes should be represented by an array, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('slug')
    ->extraAttributes(['class' => 'slug-column'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `extraAttributes()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, calling `extraAttributes()` multiple times will overwrite the previous attributes. If you wish to merge the attributes instead, you can pass `merge: true` to the method.

### Adding extra HTML attributes to the cell

You can also pass extra HTML attributes to the table cell which surrounds the content of the column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('slug')
    ->extraCellAttributes(['class' => 'slug-cell'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `extraCellAttributes()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, calling `extraCellAttributes()` multiple times will overwrite the previous attributes. If you wish to merge the attributes instead, you can pass `merge: true` to the method.

### Adding extra attributes to the header cell

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the table header cell which surrounds the content of the column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('slug')
    ->extraHeaderAttributes(['class' => 'slug-header-cell'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `extraHeaderAttributes()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, calling `extraHeaderAttributes()` multiple times will overwrite the previous attributes. If you wish to merge the attributes instead, you can pass `merge: true` to the method.

## Column utility injection

The vast majority of methods used to configure columns accept functions as parameters instead of hardcoded values:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->placeholder(fn (User $record): string => "No email for {$record->name}")

TextColumn::make('role')
    ->hidden(fn (User $record): bool => $record->role === 'admin')

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->extraAttributes(fn (User $record): array => ['class' => "{$record->getKey()}-name-column"])
```

This alone unlocks many customization possibilities.

The package is also able to inject many utilities to use inside these functions, as parameters. All customization methods that accept functions as arguments can inject utilities.

These injected utilities require specific parameter names to be used. Otherwise, Filament doesn't know what to inject.

### Injecting the current state of the column

If you wish to access the current [value (state)](#column-content-state) of the column, define a `$state` parameter:

```php
function ($state) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current Eloquent record

You may retrieve the Eloquent record for the current schema using a `$record` parameter:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

function (?Model $record) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the row loop

To access the [row loop](https://laravel.com/docs/blade#the-loop-variable) object for the current table row, define a `$rowLoop` parameter:

```php
function (stdClass $rowLoop) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current Livewire component instance

If you wish to access the current Livewire component instance, define a `$livewire` parameter:

```php
use Livewire\Component;

function (Component $livewire) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current column instance

If you wish to access the current component instance, define a `$component` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Column;

function (Column $component) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current table instance

If you wish to access the current table instance, define a `$table` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

function (Table $table) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting multiple utilities

The parameters are injected dynamically using reflection, so you’re able to combine multiple parameters in any order:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Livewire\Component as Livewire;

function (Livewire $livewire, mixed $state, User $record) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting dependencies from Laravel's container

You may inject anything from Laravel's container like normal, alongside utilities:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

function (Request $request, User $record) {
    // ...
}
```

## Global settings

If you wish to change the default behavior of all columns globally, then you can call the static `configureUsing()` method inside a service provider's `boot()` method, to which you pass a Closure to modify the columns using. For example, if you wish to make all `TextColumn` columns [`toggleable()`](#toggling-column-visibility), you can do it like so:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::configureUsing(function (TextColumn $column): void {
    $column->toggleable();
});
```

Of course, you’re still able to overwrite this on each column individually:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->toggleable(false)
```

## Introduction

Text columns display simple text:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/simple" alt="Text column" version="4.x" />

## Customizing the color

You may set a [color](../../styling/colors) for the text:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('status')
    ->color('primary')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `color()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/color" alt="Text column in the primary color" version="4.x" />

## Adding an icon

Text columns may also have an [icon](../../styling/icons):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->icon(Heroicon::Envelope)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">The `icon()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the icon. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/icon" alt="Text column with icon" version="4.x" />

You may set the position of an icon using `iconPosition()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Support\Enums\IconPosition;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->icon(Heroicon::Envelope)
    ->iconPosition(IconPosition::After) // `IconPosition::Before` or `IconPosition::After`
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">The `iconPosition()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the icon position. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/icon-after" alt="Text column with icon after" version="4.x" />

The icon color defaults to the text color, but you may customize the icon [color](../../styling/colors) separately using `iconColor()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->icon(Heroicon::Envelope)
    ->iconColor('primary')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">The `iconColor()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the icon color. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/icon-color" alt="Text column with icon in the primary color" version="4.x" />

## Displaying as a "badge"

By default, text is quite plain and has no background color. You can make it appear as a "badge" instead using the `badge()` method. A great use case for this is with statuses, where may want to display a badge with a [color](#customizing-the-color) that matches the status:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('status')
    ->badge()
    ->color(fn (string $state): string => match ($state) {
        'draft' => 'gray',
        'reviewing' => 'warning',
        'published' => 'success',
        'rejected' => 'danger',
    })
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/badge" alt="Text column as badge" version="4.x" />

You may add other things to the badge, like an [icon](#adding-an-icon).

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should be in a badge or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('status')
    ->badge(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `badge()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Formatting

When using a text column, you may want the actual outputted text in the UI to differ from the raw [state](overview#column-content-state) of the column, which is often automatically retrieved from an Eloquent model. Formatting the state allows you to preserve the integrity of the raw data while also allowing it to be presented in a more user-friendly way.

To format the state of a text column without changing the state itself, you can use the `formatStateUsing()` method. This method accepts a function that takes the state as an argument and returns the formatted state:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('status')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => __("statuses.{$state}"))
```

In this case, the `status` column in the database might contain values like `draft`, `reviewing`, `published`, or `rejected`, but the formatted state will be the translated version of these values.

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">The function passed to `formatStateUsing()` can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Date formatting

Instead of passing a function to `formatStateUsing()`, you may use the `date()`, `dateTime()`, and `time()` methods to format the column's state using [PHP date formatting tokens](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->date()

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->dateTime()

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->time()
```

You may customize the date format by passing a custom format string to the `date()`, `dateTime()`, or `time()` method. You may use any [PHP date formatting tokens](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->date('M j, Y')
    
TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->dateTime('M j, Y H:i:s')
    
TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->time('H:i:s')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `date()`, `dateTime()`, and `time()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate the format. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Date formatting using Carbon macro formats

You may use also the `isoDate()`, `isoDateTime()`, and `isoTime()` methods to format the column's state using [Carbon's macro-formats](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#available-macro-formats):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->isoDate()

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->isoDateTime()

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->isoTime()
```

You may customize the date format by passing a custom macro format string to the `isoDate()`, `isoDateTime()`, or `isoTime()` method. You may use any [Carbon's macro-formats](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#available-macro-formats):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->isoDate('L')

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->isoDateTime('LLL')

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->isoTime('LT')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `isoDate()`, `isoDateTime()`, and `isoTime()` methods also accept a function to dynamically calculate the format. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Relative date formatting

You may use the `since()` method to format the column's state using [Carbon's `diffForHumans()`](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#api-humandiff):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->since()
```

#### Displaying a formatting date in a tooltip

Additionally, you can use the `dateTooltip()`, `dateTimeTooltip()`, `timeTooltip()`, `isoDateTooltip()`, `isoDateTimeTooltip()`, `isoTime()`, `isoTimeTooltip()`, or `sinceTooltip()` method to display a formatted date in a [tooltip](overview#adding-a-tooltip-to-an-column), often to provide extra information:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->since()
    ->dateTooltip() // Accepts a custom PHP date formatting string

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->since()
    ->dateTimeTooltip() // Accepts a custom PHP date formatting string

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->since()
    ->timeTooltip() // Accepts a custom PHP date formatting string

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->since()
    ->isoDateTooltip() // Accepts a custom Carbon macro format string

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->since()
    ->isoDateTimeTooltip() // Accepts a custom Carbon macro format string

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->since()
    ->isoTimeTooltip() // Accepts a custom Carbon macro format string

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->dateTime()
    ->sinceTooltip()
```

#### Setting the timezone for date formatting

Each of the date formatting methods listed above also accepts a `timezone` argument, which allows you to convert the time set in the state to a different timezone:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->dateTime(timezone: 'America/New_York')
```

You can also pass a timezone to the `timezone()` method of the column to apply a timezone to all date-time formatting methods at once:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->timezone('America/New_York')
    ->dateTime()
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `timezone()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate the timezone. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

If you do not pass a `timezone()` to the column, it will use Filament's default timezone. You can set Filament's default timezone using the `FilamentTimezone::set()` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider such as `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentTimezone;

public function boot(): void
{
    FilamentTimezone::set('America/New_York');
}
```

This is useful if you want to set a default timezone for all text columns in your application. It is also used in other places where timezones are used in Filament.

<Aside variant="warning">
    Filament's default timezone will only apply when the column stores a time. If the column stores a date only (`date()` instead of `dateTime()`), the timezone will not be applied. This is to prevent timezone shifts when storing dates without times.
</Aside>

### Number formatting

Instead of passing a function to `formatStateUsing()`, you can use the `numeric()` method to format a column as a number:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('stock')
    ->numeric()
```

If you would like to customize the number of decimal places used to format the number with, you can use the `decimalPlaces` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('stock')
    ->numeric(decimalPlaces: 0)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `decimalPlaces` argument also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, your app's locale will be used to format the number suitably. If you would like to customize the locale used, you can pass it to the `locale` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('stock')
    ->numeric(locale: 'nl')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `locale` argument also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Money formatting

Instead of passing a function to `formatStateUsing()`, you can use the `money()` method to easily format amounts of money, in any currency:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->money('EUR')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `money()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

There is also a `divideBy` argument for `money()` that allows you to divide the original value by a number before formatting it. This could be useful if your database stores the price in cents, for example:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->money('EUR', divideBy: 100)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `divideBy` argument also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, your app's locale will be used to format the money suitably. If you would like to customize the locale used, you can pass it to the `locale` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->money('EUR', locale: 'nl')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `locale` argument also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

If you would like to customize the number of decimal places used to format the number with, you can use the `decimalPlaces` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->money('EUR', decimalPlaces: 3)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `decimalPlaces` argument also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Rendering Markdown

If your column value is Markdown, you may render it using `markdown()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->markdown()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should be rendered as Markdown or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->markdown(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `markdown()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Rendering HTML

If your column value is HTML, you may render it using `html()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->html()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should be rendered as HTML or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->html(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `html()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Rendering raw HTML without sanitization

If you use this method, then the HTML will be sanitized to remove any potentially unsafe content before it is rendered. If you'd like to opt out of this behavior, you can wrap the HTML in an `HtmlString` object by formatting it:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): HtmlString => new HtmlString($state))
```

<Aside variant="danger">
    Be cautious when rendering raw HTML, as it may contain malicious content, which can lead to security vulnerabilities in your app such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Always ensure that the HTML you are rendering is safe before using this method.
</Aside>

Alternatively, you can return a `view()` object from the `formatStateUsing()` method, which will also not be sanitized:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): View => view(
        'filament.tables.columns.description-column-content',
        ['state' => $state],
    ))
```

## Displaying a description

Descriptions may be used to easily render additional text above or below the column contents.

You can display a description below the contents of a text column using the `description()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->description(fn (Post $record): string => $record->description)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">The function passed to `description()` can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/description" alt="Text column with description" version="4.x" />

By default, the description is displayed below the main text, but you can move it using `'above'` as the second parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->description(fn (Post $record): string => $record->description, position: 'above')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/description-above" alt="Text column with description above the content" version="4.x" />

## Listing multiple values

Multiple values can be rendered in a text column if its [state](overview#column-content-state) is an array. This can happen if you are using an `array` cast on an Eloquent attribute, an Eloquent relationship with multiple results, or if you have passed an array to the [`state()` method](overview#setting-the-state-of-an-column). If there are multiple values inside your text column, they will be comma-separated. You may use the `listWithLineBreaks()` method to display them on new lines instead:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should have line breaks between each item or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `listWithLineBreaks()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Adding bullet points to the list

You may add a bullet point to each list item using the `bulleted()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('authors.name')
    ->bulleted()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should have bullet points or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('authors.name')
    ->bulleted(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `bulleted()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Limiting the number of values in the list

You can limit the number of values in the list using the `limitList()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
    ->limitList(3)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `limitList()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Expanding the limited list

You can allow the limited items to be expanded and collapsed, using the `expandableLimitedList()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
    ->limitList(3)
    ->expandableLimitedList()
```

<Aside variant="info">
    This is only a feature for `listWithLineBreaks()` or `bulleted()`, where each item is on its own line.
</Aside>

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should be expandable or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
    ->limitList(3)
    ->expandableLimitedList(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `expandableLimitedList()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Splitting a single value into multiple list items

If you want to "explode" a text string from your model into multiple list items, you can do so with the `separator()` method. This is useful for displaying comma-separated tags [as badges](#displaying-as-a-badge), for example:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('tags')
    ->badge()
    ->separator(',')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `separator()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the text size

Text columns have small font size by default, but you may change this to `TextSize::ExtraSmall`, `TextSize::Medium`, or `TextSize::Large`.

For instance, you may make the text larger using `size(TextSize::Large)`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Support\Enums\TextSize;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->size(TextSize::Large)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/large" alt="Text column in a large font size" version="4.x" />

## Customizing the font weight

Text columns have regular font weight by default, but you may change this to any of the following options: `FontWeight::Thin`, `FontWeight::ExtraLight`, `FontWeight::Light`, `FontWeight::Medium`, `FontWeight::SemiBold`, `FontWeight::Bold`, `FontWeight::ExtraBold` or `FontWeight::Black`.

For instance, you may make the font bold using `weight(FontWeight::Bold)`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `weight()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/bold" alt="Text column in a bold font" version="4.x" />

## Customizing the font family

You can change the text font family to any of the following options: `FontFamily::Sans`, `FontFamily::Serif` or `FontFamily::Mono`.

For instance, you may make the font monospaced using `fontFamily(FontFamily::Mono)`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontFamily;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->fontFamily(FontFamily::Mono)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `fontFamily()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/mono" alt="Text column in a monospaced font" version="4.x" />

## Handling long text

### Limiting text length

You may `limit()` the length of the column's value:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->limit(50)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `limit()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, when text is truncated, an ellipsis (`...`) is appended to the end of the text. You may customize this by passing a custom string to the `end` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->limit(50, end: ' (more)')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `end` argument also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

You may also reuse the value that is being passed to `limit()` in a function, by getting it using the `getCharacterLimit()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->limit(50)
    ->tooltip(function (TextColumn $column): ?string {
        $state = $column->getState();

        if (strlen($state) <= $column->getCharacterLimit()) {
            return null;
        }

        // Only render the tooltip if the column contents exceeds the length limit.
        return $state;
    })
```

### Limiting word count

You may limit the number of `words()` displayed in the column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->words(10)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `words()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, when text is truncated, an ellipsis (`...`) is appended to the end of the text. You may customize this by passing a custom string to the `end` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->words(10, end: ' (more)')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `end` argument also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Allowing text wrapping

By default, text will not wrap to the next line if it exceeds the width of the container. You can enable this behavior using the `wrap()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->wrap()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should wrap or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->wrap(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `wrap()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Limiting text to a specific number of lines

You may want to limit text to a specific number of lines instead of limiting it to a fixed length. Clamping text to a number of lines is useful in responsive interfaces where you want to ensure a consistent experience across all screen sizes. This can be achieved using the `lineClamp()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->wrap()
    ->lineClamp(2)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `lineClamp()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Allowing the text to be copied to the clipboard

You may make the text copyable, such that clicking on the column copies the text to the clipboard, and optionally specify a custom confirmation message and duration in milliseconds:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->copyable()
    ->copyMessage('Email address copied')
    ->copyMessageDuration(1500)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/copyable" alt="Text column with a button to copy it" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should be copyable or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->copyable(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `copyable()`, `copyMessage()`, and `copyMessageDuration()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Introduction

Icon columns render an [icon](../../styling/icons) representing the state of the column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

IconColumn::make('status')
    ->icon(fn (string $state): string => match ($state) {
        'draft' => Heroicon::OutlinedPencil,
        'reviewing' => Heroicon::OutlinedClock,
        'published' => Heroicon::OutlinedCheckCircle,
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">The `icon()` method can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/icon/simple" alt="Icon column" version="4.x" />

## Customizing the color

You may change the [color](../../styling/colors) of the icon, using the `color()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;

IconColumn::make('status')
    ->color('success')
```

By passing a function to `color()`, you can customize the color based on the state of the column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;

IconColumn::make('status')
    ->color(fn (string $state): string => match ($state) {
        'draft' => 'info',
        'reviewing' => 'warning',
        'published' => 'success',
        default => 'gray',
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">The `color()` method can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/icon/color" alt="Icon column with color" version="4.x" />

## Customizing the size

The default icon size is `IconSize::Large`, but you may customize the size to be either `IconSize::ExtraSmall`, `IconSize::Small`, `IconSize::Medium`, `IconSize::ExtraLarge` or `IconSize::TwoExtraLarge`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Support\Enums\IconSize;

IconColumn::make('status')
    ->size(IconSize::Medium)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `size()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/icon/medium" alt="Medium-sized icon column" version="4.x" />

## Handling booleans

Icon columns can display a check or "X" icon based on the state of the column, either true or false, using the `boolean()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;

IconColumn::make('is_featured')
    ->boolean()
```

> If this attribute in the model class is already cast as a `bool` or `boolean`, Filament is able to detect this, and you do not need to use `boolean()` manually.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/icon/boolean" alt="Icon column to display a boolean" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the icon should be boolean or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;

IconColumn::make('is_featured')
    ->boolean(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `boolean()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing the boolean icons

You may customize the [icon](../../styling/icons) representing each state:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

IconColumn::make('is_featured')
    ->boolean()
    ->trueIcon(Heroicon::OutlinedCheckBadge)
    ->falseIcon(Heroicon::OutlinedXMark)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `trueIcon()` and `falseIcon()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/icon/boolean-icon" alt="Icon column to display a boolean with custom icons" version="4.x" />

### Customizing the boolean colors

You may customize the icon [color](../../styling/colors) representing each state:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;

IconColumn::make('is_featured')
    ->boolean()
    ->trueColor('info')
    ->falseColor('warning')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `trueColor()` and `falseColor()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/icon/boolean-color" alt="Icon column to display a boolean with custom colors" version="4.x" />

## Wrapping multiple icons

When displaying multiple icons, they can be set to wrap if they can't fit on one line, using `wrap()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;

IconColumn::make('icon')
    ->wrap()
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    The "width" for wrapping is affected by the column label, so you may need to use a shorter or hidden label to wrap more tightly.
</Aside>

## Introduction

Tables can render images, based on the path in the state of the column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('avatar')
```

In this case, the `header_image` state could contain `posts/header-images/4281246003439.jpg`, which is relative to the root directory of the storage disk. The storage disk is defined in the [configuration file](../../introduction/installation#publishing-configuration), `public` by default. You can also set the `FILESYSTEM_DISK` environment variable to change this.

Alternatively, the state could contain an absolute URL to an image, such as `https://example.com/images/header.jpg`.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/image/simple" alt="Image column" version="4.x" />

## Managing the image disk

The default storage disk is defined in the [configuration file](../../introduction/installation#publishing-configuration), `public` by default. You can also set the `FILESYSTEM_DISK` environment variable to change this. If you want to deviate from the default disk, you may pass a custom disk name to the `disk()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('header_image')
    ->disk('s3')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `disk()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Public images

By default, Filament will generate temporary URLs to images in the filesystem, unless the [disk](#managing-the-image-disk) is set to `public`. If your images are stored in a public disk, you can set the `visibility()` to `public`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('header_image')
    ->visibility('public')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `visibility()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the size

You may customize the image size by passing a `imageWidth()` and `imageHeight()`, or both with `imageSize()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('header_image')
    ->imageWidth(200)

ImageColumn::make('header_image')
    ->imageHeight(50)

ImageColumn::make('avatar')
    ->imageSize(40)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static values, the `imageWidth()`, `imageHeight()` and `imageSize()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Square images

You may display the image using a 1:1 aspect ratio:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->square()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/image/square" alt="Square image column" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the image should be square or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->square(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `square()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Circular images

You may make the image fully rounded, which is useful for rendering avatars:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/image/circular" alt="Circular image column" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the image should be circular or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `circular()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Adding a default image URL

You can display a placeholder image if one doesn't exist yet, by passing a URL to the `defaultImageUrl()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('header_image')
    ->defaultImageUrl(url('storage/posts/header-images/default.jpg'))
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `defaultImageUrl()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Stacking images

You may display multiple images as a stack of overlapping images by using `stacked()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/image/stacked" alt="Stacked image column" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the images should be stacked or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `stacked()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing the stacked ring width

The default ring width is `3`, but you may customize it to be from `0` to `8`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->ring(5)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `ring()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing the stacked overlap

The default overlap is `4`, but you may customize it to be from `0` to `8`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->overlap(2)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `overlap()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Setting a limit

You may limit the maximum number of images you want to display by passing `limit()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `limit()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/image/limited" alt="Limited image column" version="4.x" />

### Showing the remaining images count

When you set a limit you may also display the count of remaining images by passing `limitedRemainingText()`.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
    ->limitedRemainingText()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/image/limited-remaining-text" alt="Limited image column with remaining text" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the remaining text should be displayed or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
    ->limitedRemainingText(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `limitedRemainingText()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

#### Customizing the limited remaining text size

By default, the size of the remaining text is `TextSize::Small`. You can customize this to be `TextSize::ExtraSmall`, `TextSize::Medium` or `TextSize::Large` using the `size` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Support\Enums\TextSize;

ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->imageHeight(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
    ->limitedRemainingText(size: TextSize::Large)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `limitedRemainingText()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Prevent file existence checks

When the schema is loaded, it will automatically detect whether the images exist to prevent errors for missing files. This is all done on the backend. When using remote storage with many images, this can be time-consuming. You can use the `checkFileExistence(false)` method to disable this feature:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('attachment')
    ->checkFileExistence(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `checkFileExistence()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Wrapping multiple images

Images can be set to wrap if they can't fit on one line, by setting `wrap()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->wrap()
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    The "width" for wrapping is affected by the column label, so you may need to use a shorter or hidden label to wrap more tightly.
</Aside>

## Adding extra HTML attributes to the image

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the `<img>` element via the `extraImgAttributes()` method. The attributes should be represented by an array, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('logo')
    ->extraImgAttributes([
        'alt' => 'Logo',
        'loading' => 'lazy',
    ])
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `extraImgAttributes()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

By default, calling `extraImgAttributes()` multiple times will overwrite the previous attributes. If you wish to merge the attributes instead, you can pass `merge: true` to the method.

## Introduction

The color column allows you to show the color preview from a CSS color definition, typically entered using the [color picker field](../../forms/color-picker), in one of the supported formats (HEX, HSL, RGB, RGBA).

```php
use Filament\Tables\Components\ColorColumn;

ColorColumn::make('color')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/color/simple" alt="Color column" version="4.x" />

## Allowing the color to be copied to the clipboard

You may make the color copyable, such that clicking on the preview copies the CSS value to the clipboard, and optionally specify a custom confirmation message and duration in milliseconds. This feature only works when SSL is enabled for the app.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Components\ColorColumn;

ColorColumn::make('color')
    ->copyable()
    ->copyMessage('Copied!')
    ->copyMessageDuration(1500)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/color/copyable" alt="Color column with a button to copy it" version="4.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the text should be copyable or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Components\ColorColumn;

ColorColumn::make('color')
    ->copyable(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing static values, the `copyable()`, `copyMessage()`, and `copyMessageDuration()` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Wrapping multiple color blocks

Color blocks can be set to wrap if they can't fit on one line, by setting `wrap()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ColorColumn;

ColorColumn::make('color')
    ->wrap()
```

<Aside variant="tip">

import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

The select column allows you to render a select field inside the table, which can be used to update that database record without needing to open a new page or a modal.

You must pass options to the column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/select/simple" alt="Select column" version="4.x" />

## Enabling the JavaScript select

By default, Filament uses the native HTML5 select. You may enable a more customizable JavaScript select using the `native(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->native(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `native()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Searching options

You may enable a search input to allow easier access to many options, using the `searchableOptions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->label('Author')
    ->options(User::query()->pluck('name', 'id'))
    ->searchableOptions()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the input should be searchable or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->label('Author')
    ->options(User::query()->pluck('name', 'id'))
    ->searchableOptions(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `searchableOptions()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Returning custom search results

If you have lots of options and want to populate them based on a database search or other external data source, you can use the `getOptionsSearchResultsUsing()` and `getOptionLabelUsing()` methods instead of `options()`.

The `getOptionsSearchResultsUsing()` method accepts a callback that returns search results in `$key => $value` format. The current user's search is available as `$search`, and you should use that to filter your results.

The `getOptionLabelUsing()` method accepts a callback that transforms the selected option `$value` into a label. This is used when the form is first loaded when the user has not made a search yet. Otherwise, the label used to display the currently selected option would not be available.

Both `getOptionsSearchResultsUsing()` and `getOptionLabelUsing()` must be used on the select if you want to provide custom search results:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->searchableOptions()
    ->getOptionsSearchResultsUsing(fn (string $search): array => User::query()
        ->where('name', 'like', "%{$search}%")
        ->limit(50)
        ->pluck('name', 'id')
        ->all())
    ->getOptionLabelUsing(fn ($value): ?string => User::find($value)?->name),
```

`getOptionLabelUsing()` is crucial, since it provides Filament with the label of the selected option, so it doesn't need to execute a full search to find it. If an option is not valid, it should return `null`.

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x" extras="Option value;;mixed;;$value;;The option value to retrieve the label for.||Search;;?string;;$search;;[<code>getOptionsSearchResultsUsing()</code> only] The current search input value, if the field is searchable.">You can inject various utilities into these functions as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Setting a custom loading message

When you're using a searchable select or multi-select, you may want to display a custom message while the options are loading. You can do this using the `optionsLoadingMessage()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->optionsRelationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchableOptions()
    ->optionsLoadingMessage('Loading authors...')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `optionsLoadingMessage()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Setting a custom no search results message

When you're using a searchable select or multi-select, you may want to display a custom message when no search results are found. You can do this using the `noOptionsSearchResultsMessage()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->optionsRelationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchableOptions()
    ->noOptionsSearchResultsMessage('No authors found.')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `noOptionsSearchResultsMessage()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Setting a custom search prompt

When you're using a searchable select or multi-select, you may want to display a custom message when the user has not yet entered a search term. You can do this using the `optionsSearchPrompt()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->optionsRelationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchableOptions(['name', 'email'])
    ->optionsSearchPrompt('Search authors by their name or email address')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `optionsSearchPrompt()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Setting a custom searching message

When you're using a searchable select or multi-select, you may want to display a custom message while the search results are being loaded. You can do this using the `optionsSearchingMessage()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->optionsRelationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchableOptions()
    ->optionsSearchingMessage('Searching authors...')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `optionsSearchingMessage()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Tweaking the search debounce

By default, Filament will wait 1000 milliseconds (1 second) before searching for options when the user types in a searchable select or multi-select. It will also wait 1000 milliseconds between searches, if the user is continuously typing into the search input. You can change this using the `optionsSearchDebounce()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->optionsRelationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchableOptions()
    ->optionsSearchDebounce(500)
```

Ensure that you are not lowering the debounce too much, as this may cause the select to become slow and unresponsive due to a high number of network requests to retrieve options from server.

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `optionsSearchDebounce()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Integrating with an Eloquent relationship

You may employ the `optionsRelationship()` method of the `SelectColumn` to configure a `BelongsTo` relationship to automatically retrieve options from. The `titleAttribute` is the name of a column that will be used to generate a label for each option:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->optionsRelationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
```

### Searching relationship options across multiple columns

By default, if the select is also searchable, Filament will return search results for the relationship based on the title column of the relationship. If you'd like to search across multiple columns, you can pass an array of columns to the `searchableOptions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->optionsRelationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchableOptions(['name', 'email'])
```

### Preloading relationship options

If you'd like to populate the searchable options from the database when the page is loaded, instead of when the user searches, you can use the `preloadOptions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->optionsRelationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchableOptions()
    ->preloadOptions()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the input should be preloaded or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->optionsRelationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchableOptions()
    ->preload(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `preload()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Excluding the current record

When working with recursive relationships, you will likely want to remove the current record from the set of results.

This can be easily be done using the `ignoreRecord` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('parent_id')
    ->optionsRelationship(name: 'parent', titleAttribute: 'name', ignoreRecord: true)
```

### Customizing the relationship query

You may customize the database query that retrieves options using the third parameter of the `optionsRelationship()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->optionsRelationship(
        name: 'author',
        titleAttribute: 'name',
        modifyQueryUsing: fn (Builder $query) => $query->withTrashed(),
    )
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x" extras="Query;;Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;;$query;;The Eloquent query builder to modify.||Search;;?string;;$search;;The current search input value, if the field is searchable.">The `modifyQueryUsing` argument can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Customizing the relationship option labels

If you'd like to customize the label of each option, maybe to be more descriptive, or to concatenate a first and last name, you could use a virtual column in your database migration:

```php
$table->string('full_name')->virtualAs('concat(first_name, \' \', last_name)');
```

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->optionsRelationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'full_name')
```

Alternatively, you can use the `getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing()` method to transform an option's Eloquent model into a label:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->optionsRelationship(
        name: 'author',
        modifyQueryUsing: fn (Builder $query) => $query->orderBy('first_name')->orderBy('last_name'),
    )
    ->getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing(fn (Model $record) => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}")
    ->searchableOptions(['first_name', 'last_name'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x" extras="Eloquent record;;Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;;$record;;The Eloquent record to get the option label for.">The `getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing()` method can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

### Remembering options

By default, when using `optionsRelationship()`, Filament will remember the options for the duration of the table page to improve performance. This means that the options function will only run once per table page instead of once per cell. You can disable this behavior using the `rememberOptions(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->optionsRelationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->rememberOptions(false)
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    When options are remembered, any record-specific options or disabled options will not work correctly, as the same options will be used for all records in the table. If you need record-specific options or disabled options, you should disable option remembering.
</Aside>

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `rememberOptions()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Allowing HTML in the option labels

By default, Filament will escape any HTML in the option labels. If you'd like to allow HTML, you can use the `allowOptionsHtml()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('technology')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => '<span class="text-blue-500">Tailwind</span>',
        'alpine' => '<span class="text-green-500">Alpine</span>',
        'laravel' => '<span class="text-red-500">Laravel</span>',
        'livewire' => '<span class="text-pink-500">Livewire</span>',
    ])
    ->searchableOptions()
    ->allowOptionsHtml()
```

<Aside variant="danger">
    Be aware that you will need to ensure that the HTML is safe to render, otherwise your application will be vulnerable to XSS attacks.
</Aside>

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the input should allow HTML or not:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('technology')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => '<span class="text-blue-500">Tailwind</span>',
        'alpine' => '<span class="text-green-500">Alpine</span>',
        'laravel' => '<span class="text-red-500">Laravel</span>',
        'livewire' => '<span class="text-pink-500">Livewire</span>',
    ])
    ->searchableOptions()
    ->allowOptionsHtml(FeatureFlag::active())
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `allowOptionsHtml()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Wrap or truncate option labels

When using the JavaScript select, labels that exceed the width of the select element will wrap onto multiple lines by default. Alternatively, you may choose to truncate overflowing labels.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('truncate')
    ->wrapOptionLabels(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `wrapOptionLabels()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Disable placeholder selection

You can prevent the placeholder (null option) from being selected using the `selectablePlaceholder(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->selectablePlaceholder(false)
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `selectablePlaceholder()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Disabling specific options

You can disable specific options using the `disableOptionWhen()` method. It accepts a closure, in which you can check if the option with a specific `$value` should be disabled:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->default('draft')
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'published')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x" extras="Option value;;mixed;;$value;;The value of the option to disable.||Option label;;string | Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable;;$label;;The label of the option to disable.">You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Limiting the number of options

You can limit the number of options that are displayed in a searchable select or multi-select using the `optionsLimit()` method. The default is 50:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->optionsRelationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchableOptions()
    ->optionsLimit(20)
```

Ensure that you are not raising the limit too high, as this may cause the select to become slow and unresponsive due to high in-browser memory usage.

<UtilityInjection set="tableColumns" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `optionsLimit()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Validation

You can validate the input by passing any [Laravel validation rules](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#available-validation-rules) in an array:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->rules(['required'])
```

### Valid options validation (`in` rule)

The `in` rule ensures that users cannot select an option that is not in the list of options. This is an important rule for data integrity purposes, so Filament applies it by default to all select fields.

Since there are many ways for a select field to populate its options, and in many cases the options are not all loaded into the select by default and require searching to retrieve them, Filament uses the presence of a valid "option label" to determine whether the selected value exists. It also checks if that option is [disabled](#disabling-specific-options) or not.

If you are using a custom search query to retrieve options, you should ensure that the `getOptionLabelUsing()` method is defined, so that Filament can validate the selected value against the available options:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('author_id')
    ->searchableOptions()
    ->getOptionsSearchResultsUsing(fn (string $search): array => Author::query()
        ->where('name', 'like', "%{$search}%")
        ->limit(50)
        ->pluck('name', 'id')
        ->all())
    ->getOptionLabelUsing(fn (string $value): ?string => Author::find($value)?->name),
```

The `getOptionLabelUsing()` method should return `null` if the option is not valid, to allow Filament to determine that the selected value is not in the list of options. If the option is valid, it should return the label of the option.

If you are using the `optionsRelationship()` method, the `getOptionLabelUsing()` method will be automatically defined for you, so you don't need to worry about it.

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within the select's lifecycle:

```php
SelectColumn::make()
    ->beforeStateUpdated(function ($record, $state) {
        // Runs before the state is saved to the database.
    })
    ->afterStateUpdated(function ($record, $state) {
        // Runs after the state is saved to the database.
    })
```

The text input column allows you to render a text input inside the table, which can be used to update that database record without needing to open a new page or a modal:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextInputColumn;

TextInputColumn::make('email')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text-input/simple" alt="Text input column" version="4.x" />

## Validation

You can validate the input by passing any [Laravel validation rules](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#available-validation-rules) in an array:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextInputColumn;

TextInputColumn::make('name')
    ->rules(['required', 'max:255'])
```

## Customizing the HTML input type

You may use the `type()` method to pass a custom [HTML input type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextInputColumn;

TextInputColumn::make('background_color')->type('color')
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within the input's lifecycle:

```php
TextInputColumn::make()
    ->beforeStateUpdated(function ($record, $state) {
        // Runs before the state is saved to the database.
    })
    ->afterStateUpdated(function ($record, $state) {
        // Runs after the state is saved to the database.
    })
```

## Introduction

The checkbox column allows you to render a checkbox inside the table, which can be used to update that database record without needing to open a new page or a modal:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\CheckboxColumn;

CheckboxColumn::make('is_admin')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/checkbox/simple" alt="Checkbox column" version="4.x" />

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within the checkbox's lifecycle:

```php
CheckboxColumn::make()
    ->beforeStateUpdated(function ($record, $state) {
        // Runs before the state is saved to the database.
    })
    ->afterStateUpdated(function ($record, $state) {
        // Runs after the state is saved to the database.
    })
```

import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

## Introduction

You may create your own custom column classes and views, which you can reuse across your project, and even release as a plugin to the community.

To create a custom column class and view, you may use the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-table-column AudioPlayerColumn
```

This will create the following component class:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Column;

class AudioPlayerColumn extends Column
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.tables.columns.audio-player-column';
}
```

It will also create a view file at `resources/views/filament/tables/columns/audio-player-column.blade.php`.

<Aside variant="info">
    Filament table columns are **not** Livewire components. Defining public properties and methods on a table column class will not make them accessible in the Blade view.
</Aside>

## Accessing the state of the column in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the [state](overview#column-content-state) of the column using the `$getState()` function:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $getState() }}
</div>
```

## Accessing the Eloquent record in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the current table row's Eloquent record using the `$record` variable:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $record->name }}
</div>
```

## Accessing the current Livewire component instance in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the current Livewire component instance using `$this`:

```blade
@php
    use Filament\Resources\Users\RelationManagers\ConferencesRelationManager;
@endphp

<div>
    @if ($this instanceof ConferencesRelationManager)
        You are editing conferences the of a user.
    @endif
</div>
```

## Accessing the current column instance in the Blade view

Inside the Blade view, you may access the current column instance using `$column`. You can call public methods on this object to access other information that may not be available in variables:

```blade
<div>
    @if ($column->isLabelHidden())
        This is a new conference.
    @endif
</div>
```

## Adding a configuration method to a custom column class

You may add a public method to the custom column class that accepts a configuration value, stores it in a protected property, and returns it again from another public method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Column;

class AudioPlayerColumn extends Column
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.tables.columns.audio-player-column';
    
    protected ?float $speed = null;

    public function speed(?float $speed): static
    {
        $this->speed = $speed;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getSpeed(): ?float
    {
        return $this->speed;
    }
}
```

Now, in the Blade view for the custom column, you may access the speed using the `$getSpeed()` function:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $getSpeed() }}
</div>
```

Any public method that you define on the custom column class can be accessed in the Blade view as a variable function in this way.

To pass the configuration value to the custom column class, you may use the public method:

```php
use App\Filament\Tables\Columns\AudioPlayerColumn;

AudioPlayerColumn::make('recording')
    ->speed(0.5)
```

## Allowing utility injection in a custom column configuration method

[Utility injection](overview#column-utility-injection) is a powerful feature of Filament that allows users to configure a component using functions that can access various utilities. You can allow utility injection by ensuring that the parameter type and property type of the configuration allows the user to pass a `Closure`. In the getter method, you should pass the configuration value to the `$this->evaluate()` method, which will inject utilities into the user's function if they pass one, or return the value if it is static:

```php
use Closure;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Column;

class AudioPlayerColumn extends Column
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.tables.columns.audio-player-column';
    
    protected float | Closure | null $speed = null;

    public function speed(float | Closure | null $speed): static
    {
        $this->speed = $speed;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getSpeed(): ?float
    {
        return $this->evaluate($this->speed);
    }
}
```

Now, you can pass a static value or a function to the `speed()` method, and [inject any utility](overview#component-utility-injection) as a parameter:

```php
use App\Filament\Tables\Columns\AudioPlayerColumn;

AudioPlayerColumn::make('recording')
    ->speed(fn (Conference $record): float => $record->isGlobal() ? 1 : 0.5)
```

## Introduction

Filters allow you to define certain constraints on your data, and allow users to scope it to find the information they need. You put them in the `$table->filters()` method.

Filters may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its unique name. You should then pass a callback to `query()` which applies your filter's scope:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            Filter::make('is_featured')
                ->query(fn (Builder $query): Builder => $query->where('is_featured', true))
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/filters/simple" alt="Table with filter" version="4.x" />

## Available filters

By default, using the `Filter::make()` method will render a checkbox form component. When the checkbox is on, the `query()` will be activated.

- You can also [replace the checkbox with a toggle](#using-a-toggle-button-instead-of-a-checkbox).
- You may use a [select filter](select) to allow users to select from a list of options, and filter using the selection.
- You can use a [ternary filter](ternary) to replace the checkbox with a select field to allow users to pick between 3 states - usually "true", "false" and "blank". This is useful for filtering boolean columns.
- The [trashed filter](ternary#filtering-soft-deletable-records) is a pre-built ternary filter that allows you to filter soft-deletable records.
- Using a [query builder](query-builder), users can create complex sets of filters, with an advanced user interface for combining constraints.
- You may build [custom filters](custom) with other form fields, to do whatever you want.

## Setting a label

By default, the label of the filter is generated from the name of the filter. You may customize this using the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('is_featured')
    ->label('Featured')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableFilters" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `label()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

Customizing the label in this way is useful if you wish to use a [translation string for localization](https://laravel.com/docs/localization#retrieving-translation-strings):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('is_featured')
    ->label(__('filters.is_featured'))
```

## Customizing the filter schema

By default, creating a filter with the `Filter` class will render a [checkbox form component](../../forms/fields/checkbox). When the checkbox is checked, the `query()` function will be applied to the table's query, scoping the records in the table. When the checkbox is unchecked, the `query()` function will be removed from the table's query.

Filters are built entirely on Filament's form fields. They can render any combination of form fields, which users can then interact with to filter the table.

### Using a toggle button instead of a checkbox

The simplest example of managing the form field that is used for a filter is to replace the [checkbox](../../forms/fields/checkbox) with a [toggle button](../../forms/fields/toggle), using the `toggle()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('is_featured')
    ->toggle()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/filters/toggle" alt="Table with toggle filter" version="4.x" />

### Customizing the built-in filter form field

Whether you are using a checkbox, a [toggle](#using-a-toggle-button-instead-of-a-checkbox) or a [select](select), you can customize the built-in form field used for the filter, using the `modifyFormFieldUsing()` method. The method accepts a function with a `$field` parameter that gives you access to the form field object to customize:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('is_featured')
    ->modifyFormFieldUsing(fn (Checkbox $field) => $field->inline(false))
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableFilters" version="4.x" extras="Field;;Filament\Forms\Components\Field;;$field;;The field object to modify.">The function passed to `modifyFormFieldUsing()` can inject various utilities as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Applying the filter by default

You may set a filter to be enabled by default, using the `default()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('is_featured')
    ->default()
```

If you're using a [select filter](select), [visit the "applying select filters by default" section](select#applying-select-filters-by-default).

## Persisting filters in the user's session

To persist the table filters in the user's session, use the `persistFiltersInSession()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->persistFiltersInSession();
}
```

## Live filters

By default, filter changes are deferred and do not affect the table, until the user clicks an "Apply" button. To disable this and make the filters "live" instead, use the `deferFilters(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->deferFilters(false);
}
```

### Customizing the apply filters action

When deferring filters, you can customize the "Apply" button, using the `filtersApplyAction()` method, passing a closure that returns an action. All methods that are available to [customize action trigger buttons](../../actions/overview) can be used:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filtersApplyAction(
            fn (Action $action) => $action
                ->link()
                ->label('Save filters to table'),
        );
}
```

## Deselecting records when filters change

By default, all records will be deselected when the filters change. Using the `deselectAllRecordsWhenFiltered(false)` method, you can disable this behavior:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->deselectAllRecordsWhenFiltered(false);
}
```

## Modifying the base query

By default, modifications to the Eloquent query performed in the `query()` method will be applied inside a scoped `where()` clause. This is to ensure that the query does not clash with any other filters that may be applied, especially those that use `orWhere()`.

However, the downside of this is that the `query()` method cannot be used to modify the query in other ways, such as removing global scopes, since the base query needs to be modified directly, not the scoped query.

To modify the base query directly, you may use the `baseQuery()` method, passing a closure that receives the base query:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletingScope;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('trashed')
    // ...
    ->baseQuery(fn (Builder $query) => $query->withoutGlobalScopes([
        SoftDeletingScope::class,
    ]))
```

## Customizing the filters trigger action

To customize the filters trigger buttons, you may use the `filtersTriggerAction()` method, passing a closure that returns an action. All methods that are available to [customize action trigger buttons](../../actions/overview) can be used:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filtersTriggerAction(
            fn (Action $action) => $action
                ->button()
                ->label('Filter'),
        );
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/filters/custom-trigger-action" alt="Table with custom filters trigger action" version="4.x" />

## Filter utility injection

The vast majority of methods used to configure filters accept functions as parameters instead of hardcoded values:

```php
use App\Models\Author;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->options(fn (): array => Author::query()->pluck('name', 'id')->all())
```

This alone unlocks many customization possibilities.

The package is also able to inject many utilities to use inside these functions, as parameters. All customization methods that accept functions as arguments can inject utilities.

These injected utilities require specific parameter names to be used. Otherwise, Filament doesn't know what to inject.

### Injecting the current filter instance

If you wish to access the current filter instance, define a `$filter` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\BaseFilter;

function (BaseFilter $filter) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current Livewire component instance

If you wish to access the current Livewire component instance that the table belongs to, define a `$livewire` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Contracts\HasTable;

function (HasTable $livewire) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current table instance

If you wish to access the current table configuration instance that the filter belongs to, define a `$table` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

function (Table $table) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting multiple utilities

The parameters are injected dynamically using reflection, so you are able to combine multiple parameters in any order:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Contracts\HasTable;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

function (HasTable $livewire, Table $table) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting dependencies from Laravel's container

You may inject anything from Laravel's container like normal, alongside utilities:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

function (Request $request, Table $table) {
    // ...
}
```

import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Introduction

Often, you will want to use a [select field](../../forms/fields/select) instead of a checkbox. This is especially true when you want to filter a column based on a set of pre-defined options that the user can choose from. To do this, you can create a filter using the `SelectFilter` class:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
```

The `options()` that are passed to the filter are the same as those that are passed to the [select field](../../forms/fields/select).

<UtilityInjection set="tableFilters" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `options()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Customizing the column used by a select filter

Select filters do not require a custom `query()` method. The column name used to scope the query is the name of the filter. To customize this, you may use the `attribute()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->attribute('status_id')
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableFilters" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `attribute()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

## Multi-select filters

These allow the user to [select multiple options](../../forms/select#multi-select) to apply the filter to their table. For example, a status filter may present the user with a few status options to pick from and filter the table using. When the user selects multiple options, the table will be filtered to show records that match any of the selected options. You can enable this behavior using the `multiple()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->multiple()
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
```

## Relationship select filters

Select filters are also able to automatically populate themselves based on a relationship. For example, if your table has a `author` relationship with a `name` column, you may use `relationship()` to filter the records belonging to an author:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->relationship('author', 'name')
```

### Preloading the select filter relationship options

If you'd like to populate the searchable options from the database when the page is loaded, instead of when the user searches, you can use the `preload()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->relationship('author', 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->preload()
```

### Filtering empty relationships

By default, upon selecting an option, all records that have an empty relationship will be excluded from the results. If you want to introduce an additional "None" option for the user to select, which will include all records that do not have a relationship, you can use the `hasEmptyOption()` argument of the `relationship()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->relationship('author', 'name', hasEmptyOption: true)
```

You can rename the "None" option using the `emptyRelationshipOptionLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->relationship('author', 'name', hasEmptyOption: true)
    ->emptyRelationshipOptionLabel('No author')
```

### Customizing the select filter relationship query

You may customize the database query that retrieves options using the third parameter of the `relationship()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->relationship('author', 'name', fn (Builder $query) => $query->withTrashed())
```

### Searching select filter options

You may enable a search input to allow easier access to many options, using the `searchable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->relationship('author', 'name')
    ->searchable()
```

## Disable placeholder selection

You can remove the placeholder (null option), which disables the filter so all options are applied, using the `selectablePlaceholder()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->default('draft')
    ->selectablePlaceholder(false)
```

## Applying select filters by default

You may set a select filter to be enabled by default, using the `default()` method. If using a single select filter, the `default()` method accepts a single option value. If using a `multiple()` select filter, the `default()` method accepts an array of option values:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->default('draft')

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->multiple()
    ->default(['draft', 'reviewing'])
```

<UtilityInjection set="tableFilters" version="4.x">As well as allowing a static value, the `default()` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<!-- Source: packages/tables/docs/03-filters/03-ternary.md -->

---

---
title: Ternary filters
---

## Introduction

Ternary filters allow you to easily create a select filter which has three states - usually true, false and blank. To filter a column named `is_admin` to be `true` or `false`, you may use the ternary filter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('is_admin')
```

## Using a ternary filter with a nullable column

Another common pattern is to use a nullable column. For example, when filtering verified and unverified users using the `email_verified_at` column, unverified users have a null timestamp in this column. To apply that logic, you may use the `nullable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('email_verified_at')
    ->nullable()
```

## Customizing the column used by a ternary filter

The column name used to scope the query is the name of the filter. To customize this, you may use the `attribute()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('verified')
    ->nullable()
    ->attribute('status_id')
```

## Customizing the ternary filter option labels

You may customize the labels used for each state of the ternary filter. The true option label can be customized using the `trueLabel()` method. The false option label can be customized using the `falseLabel()` method. The blank (default) option label can be customized using the `placeholder()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('email_verified_at')
    ->label('Email verification')
    ->nullable()
    ->placeholder('All users')
    ->trueLabel('Verified users')
    ->falseLabel('Not verified users')
```

## Customizing how a ternary filter modifies the query

You may customize how the query changes for each state of the ternary filter, use the `queries()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('email_verified_at')
    ->label('Email verification')
    ->placeholder('All users')
    ->trueLabel('Verified users')
    ->falseLabel('Not verified users')
    ->queries(
        true: fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereNotNull('email_verified_at'),
        false: fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereNull('email_verified_at'),
        blank: fn (Builder $query) => $query, // In this example, we do not want to filter the query when it is blank.
    )
```

## Filtering soft-deletable records

The `TrashedFilter` can be used to filter soft-deleted records. It is a type of ternary filter that is built-in to Filament. You can use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TrashedFilter;

TrashedFilter::make()
```


---

<!-- Source: packages/tables/docs/03-filters/04-query-builder.md -->

---

---
title: Query builder
---

## Introduction

The query builder allows you to define a complex set of conditions to filter the data in your table. It is able to handle unlimited nesting of conditions, which you can group together with "and" and "or" operations.

To use it, you need to define a set of "constraints" that will be used to filter the data. Filament includes some built-in constraints, that follow common data types, but you can also define your own custom constraints.

You can add a query builder to any table using the `QueryBuilder` filter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\BooleanConstraint;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\DateConstraint;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\NumberConstraint;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\RelationshipConstraint;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\RelationshipConstraint\Operators\IsRelatedToOperator;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\SelectConstraint;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;

QueryBuilder::make()
    ->constraints([
        TextConstraint::make('name'),
        BooleanConstraint::make('is_visible'),
        NumberConstraint::make('stock'),
        SelectConstraint::make('status')
            ->options([
                'draft' => 'Draft',
                'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
                'published' => 'Published',
            ])
            ->multiple(),
        DateConstraint::make('created_at'),
        RelationshipConstraint::make('categories')
            ->multiple()
            ->selectable(
                IsRelatedToOperator::make()
                    ->titleAttribute('name')
                    ->searchable()
                    ->multiple(),
            ),
        NumberConstraint::make('reviewsRating')
            ->relationship('reviews', 'rating')
            ->integer(),
    ])
```

When deeply nesting the query builder, you might need to increase the amount of space that the filters can consume. One way of doing this is to [position the filters above the table content](layout#displaying-filters-above-the-table-content):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\FiltersLayout;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            QueryBuilder::make()
                ->constraints([
                    // ...
                ]),
        ], layout: FiltersLayout::AboveContent);
}
```

## Available constraints

Filament ships with many different constraints that you can use out of the box. You can also [create your own custom constraints](#creating-custom-constraints):

- [Text constraint](#text-constraints)
- [Boolean constraint](#boolean-constraints)
- [Number constraint](#number-constraints)
- [Date constraint](#date-constraints)
- [Select constraint](#select-constraints)
- [Relationship constraint](#relationship-constraints)

### Text constraints

Text constraints allow you to filter text fields. They can be used to filter any text field, including via relationships.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;

TextConstraint::make('name') // Filter the `name` column

TextConstraint::make('creatorName')
    ->relationship(name: 'creator', titleAttribute: 'name') // Filter the `name` column on the `creator` relationship
```

By default, the following operators are available:

- Contains - filters a column to contain the search term
- Does not contain - filters a column to not contain the search term
- Starts with - filters a column to start with the search term
- Does not start with - filters a column to not start with the search term
- Ends with - filters a column to end with the search term
- Does not end with - filters a column to not end with the search term
- Equals - filters a column to equal the search term
- Does not equal - filters a column to not equal the search term
- Is filled - filters a column to not be empty
- Is blank - filters a column to be empty

### Boolean constraints

Boolean constraints allow you to filter boolean fields. They can be used to filter any boolean field, including via relationships.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\BooleanConstraint;

BooleanConstraint::make('is_visible') // Filter the `is_visible` column

BooleanConstraint::make('creatorIsAdmin')
    ->relationship(name: 'creator', titleAttribute: 'is_admin') // Filter the `is_admin` column on the `creator` relationship
```

By default, the following operators are available:

- Is true - filters a column to be `true`
- Is false - filters a column to be `false`

### Number constraints

Number constraints allow you to filter numeric fields. They can be used to filter any numeric field, including via relationships.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\NumberConstraint;

NumberConstraint::make('stock') // Filter the `stock` column

NumberConstraint::make('ordersItemCount')
    ->relationship(name: 'orders', titleAttribute: 'item_count') // Filter the `item_count` column on the `orders` relationship
```

By default, the following operators are available:

- Is minimum - filters a column to be greater than or equal to the search number
- Is less than - filters a column to be less than the search number
- Is maximum - filters a column to be less than or equal to the search number
- Is greater than - filters a column to be greater than the search number
- Equals - filters a column to equal the search number
- Does not equal - filters a column to not equal the search number
- Is filled - filters a column to not be empty
- Is blank - filters a column to be empty

When using `relationship()` with a number constraint, users also have the ability to "aggregate" related records. This means that they can filter the column to be the sum, average, minimum or maximum of all the related records at once.

#### Integer constraints

By default, number constraints will allow decimal values. If you'd like to only allow integer values, you can use the `integer()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\NumberConstraint;

NumberConstraint::make('stock')
    ->integer()
```

### Date constraints

Date constraints allow you to filter date fields. They can be used to filter any date field, including via relationships.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\DateConstraint;

DateConstraint::make('created_at') // Filter the `created_at` column

DateConstraint::make('creatorCreatedAt')
    ->relationship(name: 'creator', titleAttribute: 'created_at') // Filter the `created_at` column on the `creator` relationship
```

By default, the following operators are available:

- Is after - filters a column to be after the search date
- Is not after - filters a column to not be after the search date, or to be the same date
- Is before - filters a column to be before the search date
- Is not before - filters a column to not be before the search date, or to be the same date
- Is date - filters a column to be the same date as the search date
- Is not date - filters a column to not be the same date as the search date
- Is month - filters a column to be in the same month as the selected month
- Is not month - filters a column to not be in the same month as the selected month
- Is year - filters a column to be in the same year as the searched year
- Is not year - filters a column to not be in the same year as the searched year

### Select constraints

Select constraints allow you to filter fields using a select field. They can be used to filter any field, including via relationships.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\SelectConstraint;

SelectConstraint::make('status') // Filter the `status` column
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    
SelectConstraint::make('creatorStatus')
    ->relationship(name: 'creator', titleAttribute: 'department') // Filter the `department` column on the `creator` relationship
    ->options([
        'sales' => 'Sales',
        'marketing' => 'Marketing',
        'engineering' => 'Engineering',
        'purchasing' => 'Purchasing',
    ])
```

#### Searchable select constraints

By default, select constraints will not allow the user to search the options. If you'd like to allow the user to search the options, you can use the `searchable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\SelectConstraint;

SelectConstraint::make('status')
    ->searchable()
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
```

#### Multi-select constraints

By default, select constraints will only allow the user to select a single option. If you'd like to allow the user to select multiple options, you can use the `multiple()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\SelectConstraint;

SelectConstraint::make('status')
    ->multiple()
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
```

When the user selects multiple options, the table will be filtered to show records that match any of the selected options.

### Relationship constraints

Relationship constraints allow you to filter fields using data about a relationship:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\RelationshipConstraint;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\RelationshipConstraint\Operators\IsRelatedToOperator;

RelationshipConstraint::make('creator') // Filter the `creator` relationship
    ->selectable(
        IsRelatedToOperator::make()
            ->titleAttribute('name')
            ->searchable()
            ->multiple(),
    )
```

The `IsRelatedToOperator` is used to configure the "Is / Contains" and "Is not / Does not contain" operators. It provides a select field which allows the user to filter the relationship by which records are attached to it. The `titleAttribute()` method is used to specify which attribute should be used to identify each related record in the list. The `searchable()` method makes the list searchable. The `multiple()` method allows the user to select multiple related records, and if they do, the table will be filtered to show records that match any of the selected related records.

#### Multiple relationships

By default, relationship constraints only include operators that are appropriate for filtering a singular relationship, like a `BelongsTo`. If you have a relationship such as a `HasMany` or `BelongsToMany`, you may wish to mark the constraint as `multiple()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\RelationshipConstraint;

RelationshipConstraint::make('categories')
    ->multiple()
```

This will add the following operators to the constraint:

- Has minimum - filters a column to have at least the specified number of related records
- Has less than - filters a column to have less than the specified number of related records
- Has maximum - filters a column to have at most the specified number of related records
- Has more than - filters a column to have more than the specified number of related records
- Has - filters a column to have the specified number of related records
- Does not have - filters a column to not have the specified number of related records

#### Empty relationship constraints

The `RelationshipConstraint` does not support [`nullable()`](#nullable-constraints) in the same way as other constraints.

If the relationship is `multiple()`, then the constraint will show an option to filter out "empty" relationships. This means that the relationship has no related records. If your relationship is singular, then you can use the `emptyable()` method to show an option to filter out "empty" relationships:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\RelationshipConstraint;

RelationshipConstraint::make('creator')
    ->emptyable()
```

If you have a `multiple()` relationship that must always have at least 1 related record, then you can use the `emptyable(false)` method to hide the option to filter out "empty" relationships:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\RelationshipConstraint;

RelationshipConstraint::make('categories')
    ->emptyable(false)
```

#### Nullable constraints

By default, constraints will not show an option to filter `null` values. If you'd like to show an option to filter `null` values, you can use the `nullable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;

TextConstraint::make('name')
    ->nullable()
```

Now, the following operators are also available:

- Is filled - filters a column to not be empty
- Is blank - filters a column to be empty

## Scoping relationships

When you use the `relationship()` method on a constraint, you can scope the relationship to filter the related records using the `modifyQueryUsing` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextConstraint::make('adminCreatorName')
    ->relationship(
        name: 'creator',
        titleAttribute: 'name',
        modifyQueryUsing: fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_admin', true),
    )
```

## Customizing the constraint icon

Each constraint type has a default [icon](../../styling/icons), which is displayed next to the label in the picker. You can customize the icon for a constraint by passing its name to the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;

TextConstraint::make('author')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-user')
```

## Overriding the default operators

Each constraint type has a set of default operators, which you can customize by using the `operators()`method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Operators\IsFilledOperator;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;

TextConstraint::make('author')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->operators([
        IsFilledOperator::make(),
    ])
```

This will remove all operators, and register the `EqualsOperator`.

If you'd like to add an operator to the end of the list, use `pushOperators()` instead:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Operators\IsFilledOperator;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;

TextConstraint::make('author')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->pushOperators([
        IsFilledOperator::class,
    ])
```

If you'd like to add an operator to the start of the list, use `unshiftOperators()` instead:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Operators\IsFilledOperator;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;

TextConstraint::make('author')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->unshiftOperators([
        IsFilledOperator::class,
    ])
```

## Creating custom constraints

Custom constraints can be created "inline" with other constraints using the `Constraint::make()` method. You should also pass an [icon](#customizing-the-constraint-icon) to the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Constraint;

Constraint::make('subscribed')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-bell')
    ->operators([
        // ...
    ]),
```

If you want to customize the label of the constraint, you can use the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Constraint;

Constraint::make('subscribed')
    ->label('Subscribed to updates')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-bell')
    ->operators([
        // ...
    ]),
```

Now, you must [define operators](#creating-custom-operators) for the constraint. These are options that you can pick from to filter the column. If the column is [nullable](#nullable-constraints), you can also register that built-in operator for your custom constraint:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Constraint;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Operators\IsFilledOperator;

Constraint::make('subscribed')
    ->label('Subscribed to updates')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-bell')
    ->operators([
        // ...
        IsFilledOperator::class,
    ]),
```

### Creating custom operators

Custom operators can be created using the `Operator::make()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Operators\Operator;

Operator::make('subscribed')
    ->label(fn (bool $isInverse): string => $isInverse ? 'Not subscribed' : 'Subscribed')
    ->summary(fn (bool $isInverse): string => $isInverse ? 'You are not subscribed' : 'You are subscribed')
    ->baseQuery(fn (Builder $query, bool $isInverse) => $query->{$isInverse ? 'whereDoesntHave' : 'whereHas'}(
        'subscriptions.user',
        fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereKey(auth()->user()),
    )),
```

In this example, the operator is able to filter records based on whether or not the authenticated user is subscribed to the record. A subscription is recorded in the `subscriptions` relationship of the table.

The `baseQuery()` method is used to define the query that will be used to filter the records. The `$isInverse` argument is `false` when the "Subscribed" option is selected, and `true` when the "Not subscribed" option is selected. The function is applied to the base query of the table, where `whereHas()` can be used. If your function does not need to be applied to the base query of the table, like when you are using a simple `where()` or `whereIn()`, you can use the `query()` method instead, which has the bonus of being able to be used inside nested "OR" groups.

The `label()` method is used to render the options in the operator select. Two options are registered for each operator, one for when the operator is not inverted, and one for when it is inverted.

The `summary()` method is used in the header of the constraint when it is applied to the query, to provide an overview of the active constraint.

## Customizing the constraint picker

### Changing the number of columns in the constraint picker

The constraint picker has only 1 column. You may customize it by passing a number of columns to `constraintPickerColumns()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder;

QueryBuilder::make()
    ->constraintPickerColumns(2)
    ->constraints([
        // ...
    ])
```

This method can be used in a couple of different ways:

- You can pass an integer like `constraintPickerColumns(2)`. This integer is the number of columns used on the `lg` breakpoint and higher. All smaller devices will have just 1 column.
- You can pass an array, where the key is the breakpoint and the value is the number of columns. For example, `constraintPickerColumns(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will create a 2 column layout on medium devices, and a 4 column layout on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.

Breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`) are defined by Tailwind, and can be found in the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview).

### Increasing the width of the constraint picker

When you [increase the number of columns](#changing-the-number-of-columns-in-the-constraint-picker), the width of the dropdown should increase incrementally to handle the additional columns. If you'd like more control, you can manually set a maximum width for the dropdown using the `constraintPickerWidth()` method. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, `5xl`, `6xl`, `7xl`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder;

QueryBuilder::make()
    ->constraintPickerColumns(3)
    ->constraintPickerWidth('2xl')
    ->constraints([
        // ...
    ])
```

import UtilityInjection from "@components/UtilityInjection.astro"

## Custom filter schemas

You may use [schema components](../../schemas) to create custom filters. The data from the custom filter schema is available in the `$data` array of the `query()` callback:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

Filter::make('created_at')
    ->schema([
        DatePicker::make('created_from'),
        DatePicker::make('created_until'),
    ])
    ->query(function (Builder $query, array $data): Builder {
        return $query
            ->when(
                $data['created_from'],
                fn (Builder $query, $date): Builder => $query->whereDate('created_at', '>=', $date),
            )
            ->when(
                $data['created_until'],
                fn (Builder $query, $date): Builder => $query->whereDate('created_at', '<=', $date),
            );
    })
```

<UtilityInjection set="formFields" version="4.x" extras="Query;;Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;;$query;;The Eloquent query builder to modify.||Data;;array<string, mixed>;;$data;;The data from the filter's form fields.">The `query()` function can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.</UtilityInjection>

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/filters/custom-form" alt="Table with custom filter schema" version="4.x" />

### Setting default values for custom filter fields

To customize the default value of a field in a custom filter schema, you may use the `default()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('created_at')
    ->schema([
        DatePicker::make('created_from'),
        DatePicker::make('created_until')
            ->default(now()),
    ])
```

## Active indicators

When a filter is active, an indicator is displayed above the table content to signal that the table query has been scoped.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/filters/indicators" alt="Table with filter indicators" version="4.x" />

By default, the label of the filter is used as the indicator. You can override this using the `indicator()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('is_admin')
    ->label('Administrators only?')
    ->indicator('Administrators')
```

If you are using a [custom filter schema](#custom-filter-schemas), you should use [`indicateUsing()`](#custom-active-indicators) to display an active indicator.

Please note: if you do not have an indicator for your filter, then the badge-count of how many filters are active in the table will not include that filter.

### Custom active indicators

Not all indicators are simple, so you may need to use `indicateUsing()` to customize which indicators should be shown at any time.

For example, if you have a custom date filter, you may create a custom indicator that formats the selected date:

```php
use Carbon\Carbon;
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('created_at')
    ->schema([DatePicker::make('date')])
    // ...
    ->indicateUsing(function (array $data): ?string {
        if (! $data['date']) {
            return null;
        }

        return 'Created at ' . Carbon::parse($data['date'])->toFormattedDateString();
    })
```

### Multiple active indicators

You may even render multiple indicators at once, by returning an array of `Indicator` objects. If you have different fields associated with different indicators, you should set the field using the `removeField()` method on the `Indicator` object to ensure that the correct field is reset when the filter is removed:

```php
use Carbon\Carbon;
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Indicator;

Filter::make('created_at')
    ->schema([
        DatePicker::make('from'),
        DatePicker::make('until'),
    ])
    // ...
    ->indicateUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $indicators = [];

        if ($data['from'] ?? null) {
            $indicators[] = Indicator::make('Created from ' . Carbon::parse($data['from'])->toFormattedDateString())
                ->removeField('from');
        }

        if ($data['until'] ?? null) {
            $indicators[] = Indicator::make('Created until ' . Carbon::parse($data['until'])->toFormattedDateString())
                ->removeField('until');
        }

        return $indicators;
    })
```

### Preventing indicators from being removed

You can prevent users from removing an indicator using `removable(false)` on an `Indicator` object:

```php
use Carbon\Carbon;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Indicator;

Indicator::make('Created from ' . Carbon::parse($data['from'])->toFormattedDateString())
    ->removable(false)
```

## Positioning filters into grid columns

To change the number of columns that filters may occupy, you may use the `filtersFormColumns()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filtersFormColumns(3);
}
```

## Controlling the width of the filters dropdown

To customize the dropdown width, you may use the `filtersFormWidth()` method, and specify a width - `ExtraSmall`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `ExtraLarge`, `TwoExtraLarge`, `ThreeExtraLarge`, `FourExtraLarge`, `FiveExtraLarge`, `SixExtraLarge` or `SevenExtraLarge`. By default, the width is `ExtraSmall`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\Width;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filtersFormWidth(Width::FourExtraLarge);
}
```

## Controlling the maximum height of the filters dropdown

To add a maximum height to the filters' dropdown content, so that they scroll, you may use the `filtersFormMaxHeight()` method, passing a [CSS length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filtersFormMaxHeight('400px');
}
```

## Displaying filters in a modal

To render the filters in a modal instead of in a dropdown, you may use:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\FiltersLayout;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ], layout: FiltersLayout::Modal);
}
```

You may use the [trigger action API](overview#customizing-the-filters-trigger-action) to [customize the modal](../actions/modals), including [using a `slideOver()`](../actions/modals#using-a-slide-over-instead-of-a-modal).

## Displaying filters above the table content

To render the filters above the table content instead of in a dropdown, you may use:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\FiltersLayout;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ], layout: FiltersLayout::AboveContent);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/filters/above-content" alt="Table with filters above content" version="4.x" />

### Allowing filters above the table content to be collapsed

To allow the filters above the table content to be collapsed, you may use:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\FiltersLayout;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ], layout: FiltersLayout::AboveContentCollapsible);
}
```

## Displaying filters below the table content

To render the filters below the table content instead of in a dropdown, you may use:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\FiltersLayout;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ], layout: FiltersLayout::BelowContent);
}
```

## Hiding the filter indicators

To hide the active filters indicators above the table, you may use `hiddenFilterIndicators()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->hiddenFilterIndicators();
}
```

## Customizing the filter form schema

You may customize the [form schema](../../schemas/layouts) of the entire filter form at once, in order to rearrange filters into your desired layout, and use any of the [layout components](../../schemas/layout) available to forms. To do this, use the `filterFormSchema()` method, passing a closure function that receives the array of defined `$filters` that you can insert:

```php
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            Filter::make('is_featured'),
            Filter::make('published_at'),
            Filter::make('author'),
        ])
        ->filtersFormColumns(2)
        ->filtersFormSchema(fn (array $filters): array => [
            Section::make('Visibility')
                ->description('These filters affect the visibility of the records in the table.')
                ->schema([
                    $filters['is_featured'],
                    $filters['published_at'],
                ])
                    ->columns(2)
                ->columnSpanFull(),
            $filters['author'],
        ]);
}
```

In this example, we have put two of the filters inside a [section](../../schemas/sections) component, and used the `columns()` method to specify that the section should have two columns. We have also used the `columnSpanFull()` method to specify that the section should span the full width of the filter form, which is also 2 columns wide. We have inserted each filter into the form schema by using the filter's name as the key in the `$filters` array.

## Introduction

Filament's tables can use [Actions](../actions). They are buttons that can be added to the [end of any table row](#record-actions), or even in the [header](#header-actions) or [toolbar](#toolbar-actions) of a table. For instance, you may want an action to "create" a new record in the header, and then "edit" and "delete" actions on each row. [Bulk actions](#bulk-actions) can be used to execute code when records in the table are selected. Additionally, actions can be added to any [table column](#column-actions), such that each cell in that column is a trigger for your action.

It's highly advised that you read the documentation about [customizing action trigger buttons](../actions/overview) and [action modals](../actions/modals) to that you are aware of the full capabilities of actions.

## Record actions

Action buttons can be rendered at the end of each table row. You can put them in the `$table->recordActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->recordActions([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Actions may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its unique name.

You can then pass a function to `action()` which executes the task, or a function to `url()` which creates a link:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', $record))
    ->openUrlInNewTab()

Action::make('delete')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->delete())
```

All methods on the action accept callback functions, where you can access the current table `$record` that was clicked.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/simple" alt="Table with actions" version="4.x" />

### Positioning record actions before columns

By default, the record actions in your table are rendered in the final cell of each row. You may move them before the columns by using the `position` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\RecordActionsPosition;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->recordActions([
            // ...
        ], position: RecordActionsPosition::BeforeColumns);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/before-columns" alt="Table with actions before columns" version="4.x" />

### Positioning record actions before the checkbox column

By default, the record actions in your table are rendered in the final cell of each row. You may move them before the checkbox column by using the `position` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\RecordActionsPosition;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->recordActions([
            // ...
        ], position: RecordActionsPosition::BeforeCells);
}
```

### Global record action settings

To customize the default configuration used for ungrouped record actions, you can use `modifyUngroupedRecordActionsUsing()` from a [`Table::configureUsing()` function](overview#global-settings) in the `boot()` method of a service provider:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

Table::configureUsing(function (Table $table): void {
    $table
        ->modifyUngroupedRecordActionsUsing(fn (Action $action) => $action->iconButton());
});
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/before-cells" alt="Table with actions before cells" version="4.x" />

### Accessing the selected table rows

You may want an action to be able to access all the selected rows in the table. Usually, this is done with a [bulk action](#bulk-actions) in the header of the table. However, you may want to do this with a row action, where the selected rows provide context for the action.

For example, you may want to have a row action that copies the row data to all the selected records. To force the table to be selectable, even if there aren't bulk actions defined, you need to use the `selectable()` method. To allow the action to access the selected records, you need to use the `accessSelectedRecords()` method. Then, you can use the `$selectedRecords` parameter in your action to access the selected records:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->selectable()
        ->recordActions([
            Action::make('copyToSelected')
                ->accessSelectedRecords()
                ->action(function (Model $record, Collection $selectedRecords) {
                    $selectedRecords->each(
                        fn (Model $selectedRecord) => $selectedRecord->update([
                            'is_active' => $record->is_active,
                        ]),
                    );
                }),
        ]);
}
```

## Bulk actions

Tables also support "bulk actions". These can be used when the user selects rows in the table. Traditionally, when rows are selected, a "bulk actions" button appears. When the user clicks this button, they are presented with a dropdown menu of actions to choose from. You can put them in the `$table->toolbarActions()` or `$table->headerActions()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->toolbarActions([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Bulk actions may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its unique name. You should then pass a callback to `action()` which executes the task:

```php
use Filament\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete())
```

The function allows you to access the current table `$records` that are selected. It is an Eloquent collection of models.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/bulk" alt="Table with bulk action" version="4.x" />

### Authorizing bulk actions

When using a bulk action, you may check a policy method for each record that is selected. This is useful for checking if the user has permission to perform the action on each record. You can use the `authorizeIndividualRecords()` method, passing the name of a policy method, which will be called for each record. If the policy denies authorization, the record will not be present in the bulk action's `$records` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->authorizeIndividualRecords('delete')
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete())
```

### Bulk action notifications

After a bulk action is completed, you may want to send a notification to the user with a summary of the action's success. This is especially useful if you're using [authorization](#authorizing-bulk-actions) for individual records, as the user may not know how many records were actually affected.

To send a notification after the bulk action is completed, you should set the `successNotificationTitle()` and `failureNotificationTitle()`:

- The `successNotificationTitle()` is used as the title of the notification when all records have been successfully processed.
- The `failureNotificationTitle()` is used as the title of the notification when some or all of the records failed to be processed. By passing a function to this methods, you can inject the `$successCount` and `$failureCount` parameters, to provide this information to the user.

For example:

```php
use Filament\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->authorizeIndividualRecords('delete')
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete())
    ->successNotificationTitle('Deleted users')
    ->failureNotificationTitle(function (int $successCount, int $totalCount): string {
        if ($successCount) {
            return "{$successCount} of {$totalCount} users deleted";
        }

        return 'Failed to delete any users';
    })
```

You can also use a special [authorization response object](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#policy-responses) in a policy method to provide a custom message about why the authorization failed. The special object is called `DenyResponse` and replaces `Response::deny()`, allowing the developer to pass a function as the message which can receive information about how many records were denied by that authorization check:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Support\Authorization\DenyResponse;
use Illuminate\Auth\Access\Response;

class UserPolicy
{
    public function delete(User $user, User $model): bool | Response
    {
        if (! $model->is_admin) {
            return true;
        }

        return DenyResponse::make('cannot_delete_admin', message: function (int $failureCount, int $totalCount): string {
            if (($failureCount === 1) && ($totalCount === 1)) {
                return 'You cannot delete an admin user.';
            }

            if ($failureCount === $totalCount) {
                return 'All users selected were admin users.';
            }

            if ($failureCount === 1) {
                return 'One of the selected users was an admin user.';
            }

            return "{$failureCount} of the selected users were admin users.";
        });
    }
}
```

The first argument to the `make()` method is a unique key to identify that failure type. If multiple failures of that key are detected, they are grouped together and only one message is generated. If there are multiple points of failure in the policy method, each response object can have its own key, and the messages will be concatenated together in the notification.

#### Reporting failures in bulk action processing

Alongside [individual record authorization](#authorizing-bulk-actions) messages, you can also report failures in the bulk action processing itself. This is useful if you want to provide a message for each record that failed to be processed for a particular reason, even after authorization passes. This is done by injecting the `Action` instance into the `action()` function, and calling the `reportBulkProcessingFailure()` method on it, passing a key and message function similar to `DenyResponse`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->authorizeIndividualRecords('delete')
    ->action(function (BulkAction $action, Collection $records) {
        $records->each(function (Model $record) use ($action) {
            $record->delete() || $action->reportBulkProcessingFailure(
                'deletion_failed',
                message: function (int $failureCount, int $totalCount): string {
                    if (($failureCount === 1) && ($totalCount === 1)) {
                        return 'One user failed to delete.';
                    }
        
                    if ($failureCount === $totalCount) {
                        return 'All users failed to delete.';
                    }
        
                    if ($failureCount === 1) {
                        return 'One of the selected users failed to delete.';
                    }
        
                    return "{$failureCount} of the selected users failed to delete.";
                },
            );
        });
    })
    ->successNotificationTitle('Deleted users')
    ->failureNotificationTitle(function (int $successCount, int $totalCount): string {
        if ($successCount) {
            return "{$successCount} of {$totalCount} users deleted";
        }

        return 'Failed to delete any users';
    })
```

The `delete()` method on an Eloquent model returns `false` if the deletion fails, so you can use that to determine if the record was deleted successfully. The `reportBulkProcessingFailure()` method will then add a failure message to the notification, which will be displayed when the action is completed.

The `reportBulkProcessingFailure()` method can be called at multiple points during the action execution for different reasons, but you should only call it once per record. You should not proceed with the action for that particular record once you have called the method for it.

### Grouping bulk actions

You may use a `BulkActionGroup` object to [group multiple bulk actions together](../actions/grouping-actions) in a dropdown. Any bulk actions that remain outside the `BulkActionGroup` will be rendered next to the dropdown's trigger button:

```php
use Filament\Actions\BulkAction;
use Filament\Actions\BulkActionGroup;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->toolbarActions([
            BulkActionGroup::make([
                BulkAction::make('delete')
                    ->requiresConfirmation()
                    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete()),
                BulkAction::make('forceDelete')
                    ->requiresConfirmation()
                    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->forceDelete()),
            ]),
            BulkAction::make('export')->button()->action(fn (Collection $records) => ...),
        ]);
}
```

Alternatively, if all of your bulk actions are grouped, you can use the shorthand `groupedBulkActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\BulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groupedBulkActions([
            BulkAction::make('delete')
                ->requiresConfirmation()
                ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete()),
            BulkAction::make('forceDelete')
                ->requiresConfirmation()
                ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->forceDelete()),
        ]);
}
```

### Deselecting records once a bulk action has finished

You may deselect the records after a bulk action has been executed using the `deselectRecordsAfterCompletion()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete())
    ->deselectRecordsAfterCompletion()
```

### Disabling bulk actions for some rows

You may conditionally disable bulk actions for a specific record:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->toolbarActions([
            // ...
        ])
        ->checkIfRecordIsSelectableUsing(
            fn (Model $record): bool => $record->status === Status::Enabled,
        );
}
```

### Limiting the number of selectable records

You may restrict how many records the user can select in total:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->toolbarActions([
            // ...
        ])
        ->maxSelectableRecords(4);
}
```

### Preventing bulk-selection of all pages

The `selectCurrentPageOnly()` method can be used to prevent the user from easily bulk-selecting all records in the table at once, and instead only allows them to select one page at a time:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->toolbarActions([
            // ...
        ])
        ->selectCurrentPageOnly();
}
```

### Improving the performance of bulk actions

By default, a bulk action will load all Eloquent records into memory before passing them to the `action()` function.

If you are processing a large number of records, you may want to use the `chunkSelectedRecords()` method to fetch a smaller number of records at a time. This will reduce the memory usage of your application:

```php
use Filament\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Support\LazyCollection;

BulkAction::make()
    ->chunkSelectedRecords(250)
    ->action(function (LazyCollection $records) {
        // Process the records...
    })
```

You can still loop through the `$records` collection as normal, but the collection will be a `LazyCollection` instead of a normal collection.

You can also prevent Filament from fetching the Eloquent models in the first place, and instead just pass the IDs of the selected records to the `action()` function. This is useful if you are processing a large number of records, and you don't need to load them into memory:

```php
use Filament\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

BulkAction::make()
    ->fetchSelectedRecords(false)
    ->action(function (Collection $records) {
        // Process the records...
    })
```

## Header actions

Both actions and [bulk actions](#bulk-actions) can be rendered in the header of the table. You can put them in the `$table->headerActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->headerActions([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

This is useful for things like "create" actions, which are not related to any specific table row, or bulk actions that need to be more visible.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/header" alt="Table with header actions" version="4.x" />

## Toolbar actions

Both actions and [bulk actions](#bulk-actions) can be rendered in the toolbar of the table. You can put them in the `$table->toolbarActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->toolbarActions([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

This is useful for things like "create" actions, which are not related to any specific table row, or bulk actions that need to be more visible.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/toolbar" alt="Table with toolbar actions" version="4.x" />

## Column actions

Actions can be added to columns, such that when a cell in that column is clicked, it acts as the trigger for an action. You can learn more about [column actions](columns/overview#triggering-actions) in the documentation.

## Grouping actions

You may use an `ActionGroup` object to group multiple table actions together in a dropdown:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ActionGroup;
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
use Filament\Actions\EditAction;
use Filament\Actions\ViewAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->recordActions([
            ActionGroup::make([
                ViewAction::make(),
                EditAction::make(),
                DeleteAction::make(),
            ]),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## The problem with traditional table layouts

Traditional tables are notorious for having bad responsiveness. On mobile, there is only so much flexibility you have when rendering content that is horizontally long:

- Allow the user to scroll horizontally to see more table content
- Hide non-important columns on smaller devices

Both of these are possible with Filament. Tables automatically scroll horizontally when they overflow anyway, and you may choose to show and hide columns based on the responsive [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) of the browser. To do this, you may use a `visibleFrom()` or `hiddenFrom()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('slug')
    ->visibleFrom('md')
```

This is fine, but there is still a glaring issue - **on mobile, the user is unable to see much information in a table row at once without scrolling**.

Thankfully, Filament lets you build responsive table-like interfaces, without touching HTML or CSS. These layouts let you define exactly where content appears in a table row, at each responsive breakpoint.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/demo" alt="Table with responsive layout" version="4.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/demo/mobile" alt="Table with responsive layout on mobile" version="4.x" />

## Allowing columns to stack on mobile

Let's introduce a component - `Split`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Split::make([
    ImageColumn::make('avatar')
        ->circular(),
    TextColumn::make('name')
        ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
    TextColumn::make('email'),
])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/split" alt="Table with a split layout" version="4.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/split/mobile" alt="Table with a split layout on mobile" version="4.x" />

A `Split` component is used to wrap around columns, and allow them to stack on mobile.

By default, columns within a split will appear aside each other all the time. However, you may choose a responsive [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) where this behavior starts `from()`. Before this point, the columns will stack on top of each other:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Split::make([
    ImageColumn::make('avatar')
        ->circular(),
    TextColumn::make('name')
        ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
    TextColumn::make('email'),
])->from('md')
```

In this example, the columns will only appear horizontally aside each other from `md` [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) devices onwards:

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/split-desktop" alt="Table with a split layout on desktop" version="4.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/split-desktop/mobile" alt="Table with a stacked layout on mobile" version="4.x" />

### Preventing a column from creating whitespace

Splits, like table columns, will automatically adjust their whitespace to ensure that each column has proportionate separation. You can prevent this from happening, using `grow(false)`. In this example, we will make sure that the avatar image will sit tightly against the name column:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Split::make([
    ImageColumn::make('avatar')
        ->circular()
        ->grow(false),
    TextColumn::make('name')
        ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
    TextColumn::make('email'),
])
```

The other columns which are allowed to `grow()` will adjust to consume the newly-freed space:

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/grow-disabled" alt="Table with a column that doesn't grow" version="4.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/grow-disabled/mobile" alt="Table with a column that doesn't grow on mobile" version="4.x" />

### Stacking within a split

Inside a split, you may stack multiple columns on top of each other vertically. This allows you to display more data inside fewer columns on desktop:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Split::make([
    ImageColumn::make('avatar')
        ->circular(),
    TextColumn::make('name')
        ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
    Stack::make([
        TextColumn::make('phone')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-phone'),
        TextColumn::make('email')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
    ]),
])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/stack" alt="Table with a stack" version="4.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/stack/mobile" alt="Table with a stack on mobile" version="4.x" />

#### Hiding a stack on mobile

Similar to individual columns, you may choose to hide a stack based on the responsive [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) of the browser. To do this, you may use a `visibleFrom()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Split::make([
    ImageColumn::make('avatar')
        ->circular(),
    TextColumn::make('name')
        ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
    Stack::make([
        TextColumn::make('phone')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-phone'),
        TextColumn::make('email')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
    ])->visibleFrom('md'),
])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/stack-hidden-on-mobile" alt="Table with a stack" version="4.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/stack-hidden-on-mobile/mobile" alt="Table with no stack on mobile" version="4.x" />

#### Aligning stacked content

By default, columns within a stack are aligned to the start. You may choose to align columns within a stack to the `Alignment::Center` or `Alignment::End`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Split::make([
    ImageColumn::make('avatar')
        ->circular(),
    TextColumn::make('name')
        ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
    Stack::make([
        TextColumn::make('phone')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-phone')
            ->grow(false),
        TextColumn::make('email')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope')
            ->grow(false),
    ])
        ->alignment(Alignment::End)
        ->visibleFrom('md'),
])
```

Ensure that the columns within the stack have `grow(false)` set, otherwise they will stretch to fill the entire width of the stack and follow their own alignment configuration instead of the stack's.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/stack-aligned-right" alt="Table with a stack aligned right" version="4.x" />

#### Spacing stacked content

By default, stacked content has no vertical padding between columns. To add some, you may use the `space()` method, which accepts either `1`, `2`, or `3`, corresponding to [Tailwind's spacing scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/space):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Stack::make([
    TextColumn::make('phone')
        ->icon('heroicon-m-phone'),
    TextColumn::make('email')
        ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
])->space(1)
```

## Controlling column width using a grid

Sometimes, using a `Split` creates inconsistent widths when columns contain lots of content. This is because it's powered by Flexbox internally and each row individually controls how much space is allocated to content.

Instead, you may use a `Grid` layout, which uses CSS Grid Layout to allow you to control column widths:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Grid;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Grid::make([
    'lg' => 2,
])
    ->schema([
        TextColumn::make('phone')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-phone'),
        TextColumn::make('email')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
    ])
```

These columns will always consume equal width within the grid, from the `lg` [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview).

You may choose to customize the number of columns within the grid at other breakpoints:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Grid;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Grid::make([
    'lg' => 2,
    '2xl' => 4,
])
    ->schema([
        Stack::make([
            TextColumn::make('name'),
            TextColumn::make('job'),
        ]),
        TextColumn::make('phone')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-phone'),
        TextColumn::make('email')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
    ])
```

And you can even control how many grid columns will be consumed by each component at each [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Grid;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Grid::make([
    'lg' => 2,
    '2xl' => 5,
])
    ->schema([
        Stack::make([
            TextColumn::make('name'),
            TextColumn::make('job'),
        ])->columnSpan([
            'lg' => 'full',
            '2xl' => 2,
        ]),
        TextColumn::make('phone')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-phone')
            ->columnSpan([
                '2xl' => 2,
            ]),
        TextColumn::make('email')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
    ])
```

## Collapsible content

When you're using a column layout like split or stack, then you can also add collapsible content. This is very useful for when you don't want to display all data in the table at once, but still want it to be accessible to the user if they need to access it, without navigating away.

Split and stack components can be made `collapsible()`, but there is also a dedicated `Panel` component that provides a pre-styled background color and border radius, to separate the collapsible content from the rest:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Panel;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

[
    Split::make([
        ImageColumn::make('avatar')
            ->circular(),
        TextColumn::make('name')
            ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
            ->searchable()
            ->sortable(),
    ]),
    Panel::make([
        Stack::make([
            TextColumn::make('phone')
                ->icon('heroicon-m-phone'),
            TextColumn::make('email')
                ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
        ]),
    ])->collapsible(),
]
```

You can expand a panel by default using the `collapsed(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Panel;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Panel::make([
    Split::make([
        TextColumn::make('phone')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-phone'),
        TextColumn::make('email')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
    ])->from('md'),
])->collapsed(false)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/collapsible" alt="Table with collapsible content" version="4.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/collapsible/mobile" alt="Table with collapsible content on mobile" version="4.x" />

## Arranging records into a grid

Sometimes, you may find that your data fits into a grid format better than a list. Filament can handle that too!

Simply use the `$table->contentGrid()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Stack::make([
                // Columns
            ]),
        ])
        ->contentGrid([
            'md' => 2,
            'xl' => 3,
        ]);
}
```

In this example, the rows will be displayed in a grid:

- On mobile, they will be displayed in 1 column only.
- From the `md` [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview), they will be displayed in 2 columns.
- From the `xl` [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) onwards, they will be displayed in 3 columns.

These settings are fully customizable, any [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) from `sm` to `2xl` can contain `1` to `12` columns.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/grid" alt="Table with grid layout" version="4.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/grid/mobile" alt="Table with grid layout on mobile" version="4.x" />

## Custom HTML

You may add custom HTML to your table using a `View` component. It can even be `collapsible()`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\View;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

[
    Split::make([
        ImageColumn::make('avatar')
            ->circular(),
        TextColumn::make('name')
            ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
            ->searchable()
            ->sortable(),
    ]),
    View::make('users.table.collapsible-row-content')
        ->collapsible(),
]
```

Now, create a `/resources/views/users/table/collapsible-row-content.blade.php` file, and add in your HTML. You can access the table record using `$getRecord()`:

```blade
<p class="px-4 py-3 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg">
    <span class="font-medium">
        Email address:
    </span>

    <span>
        {{ $getRecord()->email }}
    </span>
</p>
```

### Embedding other components

You could even pass in columns or other layout components to the `components()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\View;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

[
    Split::make([
        ImageColumn::make('avatar')
            ->circular(),
        TextColumn::make('name')
            ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
            ->searchable()
            ->sortable(),
    ]),
    View::make('users.table.collapsible-row-content')
        ->components([
            TextColumn::make('email')
                ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
        ])
        ->collapsible(),
]
```

Now, render the components in the Blade file:

```blade
<div class="px-4 py-3 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg">
    @foreach ($getComponents() as $layoutComponent)
        {{ $layoutComponent
            ->record($getRecord())
            ->recordKey($getRecordKey())
            ->rowLoop($getRowLoop())
            ->renderInLayout() }}
    @endforeach
</div>
```

title: Summaries
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Introduction

You may render a "summary" section below your table content. This is great for displaying the results of calculations such as averages, sums, counts, and ranges of the data in your table.

By default, there will be a single summary line for the current page of data, and an additional summary line for the totals for all data if multiple pages are available. You may also add summaries for [groups](grouping) of records, see ["Summarising groups of rows"](#summarising-groups-of-rows).

"Summarizer" objects can be added to any [table column](columns) using the `summarize()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->summarize(Average::make())
```

Multiple "summarizers" may be added to the same column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Range;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->numeric()
    ->summarize([
        Average::make(),
        Range::make(),
    ])
```

> The first column in a table may not use summarizers. That column is used to render the heading and subheading/s of the summary section.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/summaries" alt="Table with summaries" version="4.x" />

## Available summarizers

Filament ships with four types of summarizer:

- [Average](#average)
- [Count](#count)
- [Range](#range)
- [Sum](#sum)

You may also [create your own custom summarizers](#custom-summaries) to display data in whatever way you wish.

## Average

Average can be used to calculate the average of all values in the dataset:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->summarize(Average::make())
```

In this example, all ratings in the table will be added together and divided by the number of ratings.

## Count

Count can be used to find the total number of values in the dataset. Unless you just want to calculate the number of rows, you will probably want to [scope the dataset](#scoping-the-dataset) as well:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Count;
use Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder;

IconColumn::make('is_published')
    ->boolean()
    ->summarize(
        Count::make()->query(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_published', true)),
    ),
```

In this example, the table will calculate how many posts are published.

### Counting the occurrence of icons

Using a count on an [icon column](columns/icon) allows you to use the `icons()` method, which gives the user a visual representation of how many of each icon are in the table:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Count;
use Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder;

IconColumn::make('is_published')
    ->boolean()
    ->summarize(Count::make()->icons()),
```

## Range

Range can be used to calculate the minimum and maximum value in the dataset:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Range;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->summarize(Range::make())
```

In this example, the minimum and maximum price in the table will be found.

### Date range

You may format the range as dates using the `minimalDateTimeDifference()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Range;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->dateTime()
    ->summarize(Range::make()->minimalDateTimeDifference())
```

This method will present the minimal difference between the minimum and maximum date. For example:

- If the minimum and maximum dates are different days, only the dates will be displayed.
- If the minimum and maximum dates are on the same day at different times, both the date and time will be displayed.
- If the minimum and maximum dates and times are identical, they will only appear once.

### Text range

You may format the range as text using the `minimalTextualDifference()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Range;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('sku')
    ->summarize(Range::make()->minimalTextualDifference())
```

This method will present the minimal difference between the minimum and maximum. For example:

- If the minimum and maximum start with different letters, only the first letters will be displayed.
- If the minimum and maximum start with the same letter, more of the text will be rendered until a difference is found.
- If the minimum and maximum are identical, they will only appear once.

### Including null values in the range

By default, we will exclude null values from the range. If you would like to include them, you may use the `excludeNull(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Range;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('sku')
    ->summarize(Range::make()->excludeNull(false))
```

## Sum

Sum can be used to calculate the total of all values in the dataset:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Sum;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->summarize(Sum::make())
```

In this example, all prices in the table will be added together.

## Setting a label

You may set a summarizer's label using the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Sum;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->summarize(Sum::make()->label('Total'))
```

## Scoping the dataset

You may apply a database query scope to a summarizer's dataset using the `query()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->summarize(
        Average::make()->query(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_published', true)),
    ),
```

In this example, now only rows where `is_published` is set to `true` will be used to calculate the average.

This feature is especially useful with the [count](#count) summarizer, as it can count how many records in the dataset pass a test:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Count;
use Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder;

IconColumn::make('is_published')
    ->boolean()
    ->summarize(
        Count::make()->query(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_published', true)),
    ),
```

In this example, the table will calculate how many posts are published.

## Formatting

### Number formatting

The `numeric()` method allows you to format an entry as a number:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->summarize(Average::make()->numeric())
```

If you would like to customize the number of decimal places used to format the number with, you can use the `decimalPlaces` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->summarize(Average::make()->numeric(
        decimalPlaces: 0,
    ))
```

By default, your app's locale will be used to format the number suitably. If you would like to customize the locale used, you can pass it to the `locale` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->summarize(Average::make()->numeric(
        locale: 'nl',
    ))
```

### Currency formatting

The `money()` method allows you to easily format monetary values, in any currency:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Sum;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->summarize(Sum::make()->money('EUR'))
```

There is also a `divideBy` argument for `money()` that allows you to divide the original value by a number before formatting it. This could be useful if your database stores the price in cents, for example:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Sum;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->summarize(Sum::make()->money('EUR', divideBy: 100))
```

By default, your app's locale will be used to format the money suitably. If you would like to customize the locale used, you can pass it to the `locale` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->summarize(Sum::make()->money('EUR', locale: 'nl'))
```

If you would like to customize the number of decimal places used to format the number with, you can use the `decimalPlaces` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->summarize(Sum::make()->money('EUR', decimalPlaces: 3))
```

### Limiting text length

You may `limit()` the length of the summary's value:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Range;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('sku')
    ->summarize(Range::make()->limit(5))
```

### Adding a prefix or suffix

You may add a prefix or suffix to the summary's value:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Sum;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

TextColumn::make('volume')
    ->summarize(Sum::make()
        ->prefix('Total volume: ')
        ->suffix(new HtmlString(' m&sup3;'))
    )
```

## Custom summaries

You may create a custom summary by returning the value from the `using()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Summarizer;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->summarize(Summarizer::make()
        ->label('First last name')
        ->using(fn (Builder $query): string => $query->min('last_name')))
```

The callback has access to the database `$query` builder instance to perform calculations with. It should return the value to display in the table.

## Conditionally hiding the summary

To hide a summary, you may pass a boolean, or a function that returns a boolean, to the `hidden()` method. If you need it, you can access the Eloquent query builder instance for that summarizer via the `$query` argument of the function:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Summarizer;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextColumn::make('sku')
    ->summarize(Summarizer::make()
        ->hidden(fn (Builder $query): bool => ! $query->exists()))
```

Alternatively, you can use the `visible()` method to achieve the opposite effect:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Summarizer;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextColumn::make('sku')
    ->summarize(Summarizer::make()
        ->visible(fn (Builder $query): bool => $query->exists()))
```

## Summarising groups of rows

You can use summaries with [groups](grouping) to display a summary of the records inside a group. This works automatically if you choose to add a summariser to a column in a grouped table.

### Hiding the grouped rows and showing the summary only

You may hide the rows inside groups and just show the summary of each group using the `groupsOnly()` method. This is beneficial in many reporting scenarios.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Sum;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('views_count')
                ->summarize(Sum::make()),
            TextColumn::make('likes_count')
                ->summarize(Sum::make()),
        ])
        ->defaultGroup('category')
        ->groupsOnly();
}
```

title: Grouping rows
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Introduction

You may allow users to group table rows together using a common attribute. This is useful for displaying lots of data in a more organized way.

Groups can be set up using the name of the attribute to group by (e.g. `'status'`), or a `Group` object which allows you to customize the behavior of that grouping (e.g. `Group::make('status')->collapsible()`).

## Grouping rows by default

You may want to always group posts by a specific attribute. To do this, pass the group to the `defaultGroup()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->defaultGroup('status');
}
```

## Allowing users to choose between groupings

You may also allow users to pick between different groupings, by passing them in an array to the `groups()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            'status',
            'category',
        ]);
}
```

You can use both `groups()` and `defaultGroup()` together to allow users to choose between different groupings, but have a default grouping set:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            'status',
            'category',
        ])
        ->defaultGroup('status');
}
```

## Grouping by a relationship attribute

You can also group by a relationship attribute using dot-syntax. For example, if you have an `author` relationship which has a `name` attribute, you can use `author.name` as the name of the attribute:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            'author.name',
        ]);
}
```

## Setting a grouping label

By default, the label of the grouping will be generated based on the attribute. You may customize it with a `Group` object, using the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('author.name')
                ->label('Author name'),
        ]);
}
```

## Setting a group title

By default, the title of a group will be the value of the attribute. You may customize it by returning a new title from the `getTitleFromRecordUsing()` method of a `Group` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('status')
                ->getTitleFromRecordUsing(fn (Post $record): string => ucfirst($record->status->getLabel())),
        ]);
}
```

### Disabling the title label prefix

By default, the title is prefixed with the label of the group. To disable this prefix, utilize the `titlePrefixedWithLabel(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('status')
                ->titlePrefixedWithLabel(false),
        ]);
}
```

## Setting a group description

You may also set a description for a group, which will be displayed underneath the group title. To do this, use the `getDescriptionFromRecordUsing()` method on a `Group` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('status')
                ->getDescriptionFromRecordUsing(fn (Post $record): string => $record->status->getDescription()),
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/grouping-descriptions" alt="Table with group descriptions" version="4.x" />

## Setting a group key

By default, the key of a group will be the value of the attribute. It is used internally as a raw identifier of that group, instead of the [title](#setting-a-group-title). You may customize it by returning a new key from the `getKeyFromRecordUsing()` method of a `Group` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('status')
                ->getKeyFromRecordUsing(fn (Post $record): string => $record->status->value),
        ]);
}
```

## Date groups

When using a date-time column as a group, you may want to group by the date only, and ignore the time. To do this, use the `date()` method on a `Group` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('created_at')
                ->date(),
        ]);
}
```

## Collapsible groups

You can allow rows inside a group to be collapsed underneath their group title. To enable this, use a `Group` object with the `collapsible()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('author.name')
                ->collapsible(),
        ]);
}
```

## Summarising groups

You can use [summaries](summaries) with groups to display a summary of the records inside a group. This works automatically if you choose to add a summariser to a column in a grouped table.

### Hiding the grouped rows and showing the summary only

You may hide the rows inside groups and just show the summary of each group using the `groupsOnly()` method. This is very useful in many reporting scenarios.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Sum;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('views_count')
                ->summarize(Sum::make()),
            TextColumn::make('likes_count')
                ->summarize(Sum::make()),
        ])
        ->defaultGroup('category')
        ->groupsOnly();
}
```

## Customizing the Eloquent query ordering behavior

Some features require the table to be able to order an Eloquent query according to a group. You can customize how we do this using the `orderQueryUsing()` method on a `Group` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('status')
                ->orderQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query, string $direction) => $query->orderBy('status', $direction)),
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing the Eloquent query scoping behavior

Some features require the table to be able to scope an Eloquent query according to a group. You can customize how we do this using the `scopeQueryByKeyUsing()` method on a `Group` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('status')
                ->scopeQueryByKeyUsing(fn (Builder $query, string $key) => $query->where('status', $key)),
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing the Eloquent query grouping behavior

Some features require the table to be able to group an Eloquent query according to a group. You can customize how we do this using the `groupQueryUsing()` method on a `Group` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('status')
                ->groupQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->groupBy('status')),
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing the groups dropdown trigger action

To customize the groups dropdown trigger button, you may use the `groupRecordsTriggerAction()` method, passing a closure that returns an action. All methods that are available to [customize action trigger buttons](../actions/overview) can be used:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            // ...
        ])
        ->groupRecordsTriggerAction(
            fn (Action $action) => $action
                ->button()
                ->label('Group records'),
        );
}
```

## Using the grouping settings dropdown on desktop

By default, the grouping settings dropdown will only be shown on mobile devices. On desktop devices, the grouping settings are in the header of the table. You can enable the dropdown on desktop devices too by using the `groupingSettingsInDropdownOnDesktop()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            // ...
        ])
        ->groupingSettingsInDropdownOnDesktop();
}
```

## Hiding the grouping settings

You can hide the grouping settings interface using the `groupingSettingsHidden()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
		->defaultGroup('status')
        ->groupingSettingsHidden();
}
```

### Hiding the grouping direction setting only

You can hide the grouping direction select interface using the `groupingDirectionSettingHidden()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
		->defaultGroup('status')
        ->groupingDirectionSettingHidden();
}
```

## Introduction

The table's "empty state" is rendered when there are no rows in the table.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/empty-state" alt="Table with empty state" version="4.x" />

## Setting the empty state heading

To customize the heading of the empty state, use the `emptyStateHeading()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->emptyStateHeading('No posts yet');
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/empty-state-heading" alt="Table with customized empty state heading" version="4.x" />

## Setting the empty state description

To customize the description of the empty state, use the `emptyStateDescription()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->emptyStateDescription('Once you write your first post, it will appear here.');
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/empty-state-description" alt="Table with empty state description" version="4.x" />

## Setting the empty state icon

To customize the [icon](../styling/icons) of the empty state, use the `emptyStateIcon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->emptyStateIcon('heroicon-o-bookmark');
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/empty-state-icon" alt="Table with customized empty state icon" version="4.x" />

## Adding empty state actions

You can add [Actions](actions) to the empty state to prompt users to take action. Pass these to the `emptyStateActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->emptyStateActions([
            Action::make('create')
                ->label('Create post')
                ->url(route('posts.create'))
                ->icon('heroicon-m-plus')
                ->button(),
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/empty-state-actions" alt="Table with empty state actions" version="4.x" />

## Using a custom empty state view

You may use a completely custom empty state view by passing it to the `emptyState()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->emptyState(view('tables.posts.empty-state'));
}
```

title: Custom data
---
import Aside from "@components/Aside.astro"

## Introduction

[Filament's table builder](overview/#introduction) was originally designed to render data directly from a SQL database using [Eloquent models](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent) in a Laravel application. Each row in a Filament table corresponds to a row in the database, represented by an Eloquent model instance.

However, this setup isn't always possible or practical. You might need to display data that isn't stored in a database—or data that is stored, but not accessible via Eloquent.

In such cases, you can use custom data instead. Pass a function to the `records()` method of the table builder that returns an array of data. This function is called when the table renders, and the value it returns is used to populate the table.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->records(fn (): array => [
            1 => [
                'title' => 'First item',
                'slug' => 'first-item',
                'is_featured' => true,
            ],
            2 => [
                'title' => 'Second item',
                'slug' => 'second-item',
                'is_featured' => false,
            ],
            3 => [
                'title' => 'Third item',
                'slug' => 'third-item',
                'is_featured' => true,
            ],
        ])
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('slug'),
            IconColumn::make('is_featured')
                ->boolean(),
        ]);
}
```

<Aside variant="warning">
    The array keys `(e.g., 1, 2, 3)` represent the record IDs. Use unique and consistent keys to ensure proper diffing and state tracking. This helps prevent issues with record integrity during Livewire interactions and updates.
</Aside>

## Columns

[Columns](columns) in the table work similarly to how they do when using [Eloquent models](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent), but with one key difference: instead of referring to a model attribute or relationship, the column name represents a key in the array returned by the `records()` function.

When working with the current record inside a column function, set the `$record` type to `array` instead of `Model`. For example, to define a column using the [`state()`](columns#setting-the-state-of-a-column) function, you could do the following:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('is_featured')
    ->state(function (array $record): string {
        return $record['is_featured'] ? 'Featured' : 'Not featured';
    })
```

### Sorting

Filament's built-in [sorting](columns#sorting) function uses SQL to sort data. When working with custom data, you'll need to handle sorting yourself.

To access the currently sorted column and direction, you can inject `$sortColumn` and `$sortDirection` into the `records()` function. These variables are `null` if no sorting is applied.

In the example below, a [collection](https://laravel.com/docs/collections#method-sortby) is used to sort the data by key. The collection is returned instead of an array, and Filament handles it the same way. However, using a collection is not required to use this feature.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->records(
            fn (?string $sortColumn, ?string $sortDirection): Collection => collect([
                1 => ['title' => 'First item'],
                2 => ['title' => 'Second item'],
                3 => ['title' => 'Third item'],
            ])->when(
                filled($sortColumn),
                fn (Collection $data): Collection => $data->sortBy(
                    $sortColumn,
                    SORT_REGULAR,
                    $sortDirection === 'desc',
                ),
            )
        )
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title')
                ->sortable(),
        ]);
}
```

<Aside variant="info">
    It might seem like Filament should sort the data for you, but in many cases, it's better to let your data source—like a custom query or API call—handle the sorting instead.
</Aside>

### Searching

Filament's built-in [searching](columns#searching) function uses SQL to search data. When working with custom data, you'll need to handle searching yourself.

To access the current search query, you can inject `$search` into the `records()` function. This variable is `null` if no search query is currently being used.

In the example below, a [collection](https://laravel.com/docs/collections#method-filter) is used to filter the data by the search query. The collection is returned instead of an array, and Filament handles it the same way. However, using a collection is not required to use this feature.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->records(
            fn (?string $search): Collection => collect([
                1 => ['title' => 'First item'],
                2 => ['title' => 'Second item'],
                3 => ['title' => 'Third item'],
            ])->when(
                filled($search),
                fn (Collection $data): Collection => $data->filter(
                    fn (array $record): bool => str_contains(
                        Str::lower($record['title']),
                        Str::lower($search),
                    ),
                ),
            )
        )
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
        ])
        ->searchable();
}
```

In this example, specific columns like `title` do not need to be `searchable()` because the search logic is handled inside the `records()` function. However, if you want to enable the search field without enabling search for a specific column, you can use the `searchable()` method on the entire table.

<Aside variant="info">
    It might seem like Filament should search the data for you, but in many cases, it's better to let your data source—like a custom query or API call—handle the searching instead.
</Aside>

#### Searching individual columns

The [individual column searches](#searching-individually) feature provides a way to render a search field separately for each column, allowing more precise filtering. When using custom data, you need to implement this feature yourself.

Instead of injecting `$search` into the `records()` function, you can inject an array of `$columnSearches`, which contains the search queries for each column.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->records(
            fn (array $columnSearches): Collection => collect([
                1 => ['title' => 'First item'],
                2 => ['title' => 'Second item'],
                3 => ['title' => 'Third item'],
            ])->when(
                filled($columnSearches['title'] ?? null),
                fn (Collection $data) => $data->filter(
                    fn (array $record): bool => str_contains(
                        Str::lower($record['title']),
                        Str::lower($columnSearches['title'])
                    ),
                ),
            )
        )
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title')
                ->searchable(isIndividual: true),
        ]);
}
```

<Aside variant="info">
    It might seem like Filament should search the data for you, but in many cases, it's better to let your data source—like a custom query or API call—handle the searching instead.
</Aside>

## Filters

Filament also provides a way to filter data using [filters](filters). When working with custom data, you'll need to handle filtering yourself. 

Filament gives you access to an array of filter data by injecting `$filters` into the `records()` function. The array contains the names of the filters as keys and the values of the filter forms themselves.

In the example below, a [collection](https://laravel.com/docs/collections#method-where) is used to filter the data. The collection is returned instead of an array, and Filament handles it the same way. However, using a collection is not required to use this feature.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->records(fn (array $filters): Collection => collect([
            1 => [
                'title' => 'What is Filament?',
                'slug' => 'what-is-filament',
                'author' => 'Dan Harrin',
                'is_featured' => true,
                'creation_date' => '2021-01-01',
            ],
            2 => [
                'title' => 'Top 5 best features of Filament',
                'slug' => 'top-5-features',
                'author' => 'Ryan Chandler',
                'is_featured' => false,
                'creation_date' => '2021-03-01',
            ],
            3 => [
                'title' => 'Tips for building a great Filament plugin',
                'slug' => 'plugin-tips',
                'author' => 'Zep Fietje',
                'is_featured' => true,
                'creation_date' => '2023-06-01',
            ],
        ])
            ->when(
                $filters['is_featured']['isActive'] ?? false,
                fn (Collection $data): Collection => $data->where(
                    'is_featured', true
                ),
            )
            ->when(
                filled($author = $filters['author']['value'] ?? null),
                fn (Collection $data): Collection => $data->where(
                    'author', $author
                ),
            )
            ->when(
                filled($date = $filters['creation_date']['date'] ?? null),
                fn (Collection $data): Collection => $data->where(
                    'creation_date', $date
                ),
            )
        )
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('slug'),
            IconColumn::make('is_featured')
                ->boolean(),
            TextColumn::make('author'),
        ])
        ->filters([
            Filter::make('is_featured'),
            SelectFilter::make('author')
                ->options([
                    'Dan Harrin' => 'Dan Harrin',
                    'Ryan Chandler' => 'Ryan Chandler',
                    'Zep Fietje' => 'Zep Fietje',
                ]),
            Filter::make('creation_date')
                ->schema([
                    DatePicker::make('date'),
                ]),
        ]);
}
```

Filter values aren't directly accessible via `$filters['filterName']`. Instead, each filter contains one or more form fields, and those field names are used as keys within the filter's data array. For example:

- [Checkbox](filters/overview#introduction) or [Toggle filters](filters/overview#using-a-toggle-button-instead-of-a-checkbox) without a custom schema (e.g., featured) use `isActive` as the `key`: `$filters['featured']['isActive']`

- [Select filters](filters/select#introduction) (e.g., author) use `value`: `$filters['author']['value']`

- [Custom schema filters](filters/custom#custom-filter-schemas) (e.g., creation_date) use the actual form field names. If the field is named `date`, access it like this: `$filters['creation_date']['date']`

    It might seem like Filament should filter the data for you, but in many cases, it's better to let your data source—like a custom query or API call—handle the filtering instead.
</Aside>

## Pagination

Filament's built-in [pagination](overview#pagination) feature uses SQL to paginate the data. When working with custom data, you'll need to handle pagination yourself. 

The `$page` and `$recordsPerPage` arguments are injected into the `records()` function, and you can use them to paginate the data. A `LengthAwarePaginator` should be returned from the `records()` function, and Filament will handle the pagination links and other pagination features for you:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Pagination\LengthAwarePaginator;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->records(function (int $page, int $recordsPerPage): LengthAwarePaginator {
            $records = collect([
                1 => ['title' => 'What is Filament?'],
                2 => ['title' => 'Top 5 best features of Filament'],
                3 => ['title' => 'Tips for building a great Filament plugin'],
            ])->forPage($page, $recordsPerPage);

            return new LengthAwarePaginator(
                $records,
                total: 30, // Total number of records across all pages
                perPage: $recordsPerPage,
                currentPage: $page,
            );
        })
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
        ]);
}
```

In this example, the `forPage()` method is used to paginate the data. This probably isn't the most efficient way to paginate data from a query or API, but it is a simple way to demonstrate how to paginate data from a custom array.

## Actions

[Actions](actions) in the table work similarly to how they do when using [Eloquent models](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent). The only difference is that the `$record` parameter in the action's callback function will be an `array` instead of a `Model`.

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->records(fn (): Collection => collect([
            1 => [
                'title' => 'What is Filament?',
                'slug' => 'what-is-filament',
            ],
            2 => [
                'title' => 'Top 5 best features of Filament',
                'slug' => 'top-5-features',
            ],
            3 => [
                'title' => 'Tips for building a great Filament plugin',
                'slug' => 'plugin-tips',
            ],
        ]))
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('slug'),
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            Action::make('view')
                ->color('gray')
                ->icon(Heroicon::Eye)
                ->url(fn (array $record): string => route('posts.view', $record['slug'])),
        ]);
}
```

### Bulk actions

For actions that interact with a single record, the record is always present on the current table page, so the `records()` method can be used to fetch the data. However for bulk actions, records can be selected across pagination pages. If you would like to use a bulk action that selects records across pages, you need to give Filament a way to fetch records across pages, otherwise it will only return the records from the current page. The `resolveSelectedRecordsUsing()` method should accept a function which has a `$keys` parameter, and returns an array of record data:

```php
use Filament\Actions\BulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Support\Arr;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->records(function (): array {
            // ...
        })
        ->resolveSelectedRecordsUsing(function (array $keys): array {
            return Arr::only([
                1 => [
                    'title' => 'First item',
                    'slug' => 'first-item',
                    'is_featured' => true,
                ],
                2 => [
                    'title' => 'Second item',
                    'slug' => 'second-item',
                    'is_featured' => false,
                ],
                3 => [
                    'title' => 'Third item',
                    'slug' => 'third-item',
                    'is_featured' => true,
                ],
            ], $keys);
        })
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            BulkAction::make('feature')
                ->requiresConfirmation()
                ->action(function (Collection $records): void {
                    // Do something with the collection of `$records` data
                }),
        ]);
}
```

However, if your user uses the "Select All" button to select all records across pagination pages, Filament will internally switch to tracking *deselected* records instead of selected records. This is an efficient mechanism in significantly large datasets. You can inject two additional parameters into the `resolveSelectedRecordsUsing()` method to handle this case: `$isTrackingDeselectedKeys` and `$deselectedKeys`.

`$isTrackingDeselectedKeys` is a boolean that indicates whether the user is tracking deselected keys. If it's `true`, `$deselectedKeys` will contain the keys of the records that are currently deselected. You can use this information to filter out the deselected records from the array of records returned by the `resolveSelectedRecordsUsing()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\BulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Support\Arr;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->records(function (): array {
            // ...
        })
        ->resolveSelectedRecordsUsing(function (
            array $keys,
            bool $isTrackingDeselectedKeys,
            array $deselectedKeys
        ): array {
            $records = [
                1 => [
                    'title' => 'First item',
                    'slug' => 'first-item',
                    'is_featured' => true,
                ],
                2 => [
                    'title' => 'Second item',
                    'slug' => 'second-item',
                    'is_featured' => false,
                ],
                3 => [
                    'title' => 'Third item',
                    'slug' => 'third-item',
                    'is_featured' => true,
                ],
            ];
            
            if ($isTrackingDeselectedKeys) {
                return Arr::except(
                    $records,
                    $deselectedKeys,
                );
            }
            
            return Arr::only(
                $records,
                $keys,
            );
        })
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            BulkAction::make('feature')
                ->requiresConfirmation()
                ->action(function (Collection $records): void {
                    // Do something with the collection of `$records` data
                }),
        ]);
}
```

## Using an external API as a table data source

[Filament's table builder](overview/#introduction) allows you to populate tables with data fetched from any external source—not just [Eloquent models](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent). This is particularly useful when you want to display data from a REST API or a third-party service.

### Fetching data from an external API

The example below demonstrates how to consume data from [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com), a free fake REST API for placeholder JSON, and display it in a [Filament table](overview/#introduction):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->records(fn (): array => Http::baseUrl('https://dummyjson.com')
            ->get('products')
            ->collect()
            ->get('products', [])
        )
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('category'),
            TextColumn::make('price')
                ->money(),
        ]);
}
```

`get('products')` makes a `GET` request to [`https://dummyjson.com/products`](https://dummyjson.com/products). The `collect()` method converts the JSON response into a [Laravel collection](https://laravel.com/docs/collections#main-content). Finally, `get('products', [])` retrieves the array of products from the response. If the key is missing, it safely returns an empty array.

<Aside variant="warning">
    This is a basic example for demonstration purposes only. It's the developer's responsibility to implement proper authentication, authorization, validation, error handling, rate limiting, and other best practices when working with APIs.
</Aside>

<Aside variant="info">
    DummyJSON returns 30 items by default. You can use the [limit and skip](#external-api-pagination) query parameters to paginate through all items or use [`limit=0`](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products#products-limit_skip) to get all items.
</Aside>

#### Setting the state of a column using API data

[Columns](#columns) map to the array keys returned by the `records()` function.

When working with the current record inside a column function, set the `$record` type to `array` instead of `Model`. For example, to define a column using the [`state()`](columns/overview#setting-the-state-of-a-column) function, you could do the following:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

TextColumn::make('category_brand')
    ->label('Category - Brand')
    ->state(function (array $record): string {
        $category = Str::headline($record['category']);
        $brand = Str::title($record['brand'] ?? 'Unknown');

        return "{$category} - {$brand}";
    })
```

<Aside variant="tip">
    You can use the [`formatStateUsing()`](columns/text#formatting) method to format the state of a text column without changing the state itself.
</Aside>

### External API sorting

You can enable [sorting](columns#sorting) in [columns](columns) even when using an external API as the data source. The example below demonstrates how to pass sorting parameters (`sort_column` and `sort_direction`) to the [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products#products-sort) API and how they are handled by the API.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->records(function (?string $sortColumn, ?string $sortDirection): array {
            $response = Http::baseUrl('https://dummyjson.com/')
                ->get('products', [
                    'sortBy' => $sortColumn,
                    'order' => $sortDirection,
                ]);

            return $response
                ->collect()
                ->get('products', []);
        })
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('category')
                ->sortable(),
            TextColumn::make('price')
                ->money(),
        ]);
}
```
`get('products')` makes a `GET` request to [`https://dummyjson.com/products`](https://dummyjson.com/products). The request includes two parameters: `sortBy`, which specifies the column to sort by (e.g., category), and `order`, which specifies the direction of the sort (e.g., asc or desc). The `collect()` method converts the JSON response into a [Laravel collection](https://laravel.com/docs/collections#main-content). Finally, `get('products', [])` retrieves the array of products from the response. If the key is missing, it safely returns an empty array.

<Aside variant="warning">

    DummyJSON returns 30 items by default. You can use the [limit and skip](#external-api-pagination) query parameters to paginate through all items or use [`limit=0`](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products#products-limit_skip) to get all items.
</Aside>

### External API searching

You can enable [searching](columns#searching) in [columns](columns) even when using an external API as the data source. The example below demonstrates how to pass the `search` parameter to the [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products#products-search) API and how it is handled by the API.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->records(function (?string $search): array {
            $response = Http::baseUrl('https://dummyjson.com/')
                ->get('products/search', [
                    'q' => $search,
                ]);

            return $response
                ->collect()
                ->get('products', []);
        })
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('category'),
            TextColumn::make('price')
                ->money(),
        ])
        ->searchable();
}
```

`get('products/search')` makes a `GET` request to [`https://dummyjson.com/products/search`](https://dummyjson.com/products/search). The request includes the `q` parameter, which is used to filter the results based on the `search` query. The `collect()` method converts the JSON response into a [Laravel collection](https://laravel.com/docs/collections#main-content). Finally, `get('products', [])` retrieves the array of products from the response. If the key is missing, it safely returns an empty array.

</Aside>

### External API filtering

You can enable [filtering](filters) in your table even when using an external API as the data source. The example below demonstrates how to pass the `filter` parameter to the [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products#products-search) API and how it is handled by the API.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->records(function (array $filters): array {
            $category = $filters['category']['value'] ?? null;

            $endpoint = filled($category)
                ? "products/category/{$category}"
                : 'products';

            $response = Http::baseUrl('https://dummyjson.com/')
                ->get($endpoint);

            return $response
                ->collect()
                ->get('products', []);
        })
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('category'),
            TextColumn::make('price')
                ->money(),
        ])
        ->filters([
            SelectFilter::make('category')
                ->label('Category')
                ->options(fn (): Collection => Http::baseUrl('https://dummyjson.com/')
                    ->get('products/categories')
                    ->collect()
                    ->pluck('name', 'slug')
                ),
        ]);
}
```

If a category filter is selected, the request is made to `/products/category/{category}`; otherwise, it defaults to `/products`. The `get()` method sends a `GET` request to the appropriate endpoint. The `collect()` method converts the JSON response into a [Laravel collection](https://laravel.com/docs/collections#main-content). Finally, `get('products', [])` retrieves the array of products from the response. If the key is missing, it safely returns an empty array.

<Aside variant="warning">

    DummyJSON returns 30 items by default. You can use the [limit and skip](#external-api-pagination) query parameters to paginate through all items or use [`limit=0`](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products#products-limit_skip) to get all items.
</Aside>

### External API pagination

You can enable [pagination](overview#pagination) when using an external API as the table data source. Filament will pass the current page and the number of records per page to your `records()` function. The example below demonstrates how to construct a `LengthAwarePaginator` manually and fetch paginated data from the [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products#products-limit_skip) API, which uses `limit` and `skip` parameters for pagination:

```php
public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->records(function (int $page, int $recordsPerPage): LengthAwarePaginator {
            $skip = ($page - 1) * $recordsPerPage;

            $response = Http::baseUrl('https://dummyjson.com')
                ->get('products', [
                    'limit' => $recordsPerPage,
                    'skip' => $skip,
                ])
                ->collect();

            return new LengthAwarePaginator(
                items: $response['products'],
                total: $response['total'],
                perPage: $recordsPerPage,
                currentPage: $page
            );
        })
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('category'),
            TextColumn::make('price')
                ->money(),
        ]);
}
```

`$page` and `$recordsPerPage` are automatically injected by Filament based on the current pagination state.
The calculated `skip` value tells the API how many records to skip before returning results for the current page.
The response contains `products` (the paginated items) and `total` (the total number of available items).
These values are passed to a `LengthAwarePaginator`, which Filament uses to render pagination controls correctly.

### External API actions

When using [actions](../actions/overview) in a table with an external API, the process is almost identical to working with [Eloquent models](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent). The main difference is that the `$record` parameter in the action's callback function will be an `array` instead of a `Model` instance.

Filament provides a variety of [built-in actions](../actions/overview#available-actions) that you can use in your application. However, you are not limited to these. You can create [custom actions](../actions/overview#introduction) tailored to your application's needs.

The examples below demonstrate how to create and use actions with an external API using [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com) as a simulated API source.

#### External API create action example

The create action in this example provides a [modal form](../actions/modals#rendering-a-form-in-a-modal) that allows users to create a new product using an external API. When the form is submitted, a `POST` request is sent to the API to create the new product.

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    $baseUrl = 'https://dummyjson.com';

    return $table
        ->records(fn (): array => Http::baseUrl($baseUrl)
            ->get('products')
            ->collect()
            ->get('products', [])
        )
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('category'),
        ])
        ->headerActions([
            Action::make('create')
                ->modalHeading('Create product')
                ->schema([
                    TextInput::make('title')
                        ->required(),
                    Select::make('category')
                        ->options(fn (): Collection => Http::get("{$baseUrl}/products/categories")
                            ->collect()
                            ->pluck('name', 'slug')
                        )
                        ->required(),
                ])
                ->action(function (array $data) use ($baseUrl) {
                    $response = Http::post("{$baseUrl}/products/add", [
                        'title' => $data['title'],
                        'category' => $data['category'],
                    ]);

                    if ($response->failed()) {
                        Notification::make()
                            ->title('Product failed to create')
                            ->danger()
                            ->send();
                            
                        return;
                    }
                    
                    Notification::make()
                        ->title('Product created')
                        ->success()
                        ->send();
                }),
        ]);
}
```

- [`modalHeading()`](../actions/modals#customizing-the-modals-heading-description-and-submit-action-label) sets the title of the modal that appears when the action is triggered.
- [`schema()`](../actions/modals#rendering-a-schema-in-a-modal) defines the form fields displayed in the modal.
- `action()` defines the logic that will be executed when the user submits the form.

    This is a basic example for demonstration purposes only. It's the developer's responsibility to implement proper authentication, authorization, validation, error handling, rate limiting, and other best practices when working with APIs.
</Aside>

<Aside variant="warning">
    [`DummyJSON`](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products#products-update) API will not add it into the server. It will simulate a `POST` request and will return the new created product with a new id.
</Aside>

If you don't need a modal, you can directly redirect users to a specified URL when they click the create action button. In this case, you can define a custom URL pointing to the product creation page:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('create')
    ->url(route('products.create'))
```

#### External API edit action example

The edit action in this example provides a [modal form](../actions/modals#rendering-a-form-in-a-modal) for editing product details fetched from an external API. Users can update fields such as the product title and category, and the changes will be sent to the external API using a `PUT` request.

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    $baseUrl = 'https://dummyjson.com';

    return $table
        ->records(fn (): array => Http::baseUrl($baseUrl)
            ->get('products')
            ->collect()
            ->get('products', [])
        )
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('category'),
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            Action::make('edit')
                ->icon(Heroicon::PencilSquare)
                ->modalHeading('Edit product')
                ->fillForm(fn (array $record) => $record)
                ->schema([
                    TextInput::make('title')
                        ->required(),
                    Select::make('category')
                        ->options(fn (): Collection => Http::get("{$baseUrl}/products/categories")
                            ->collect()
                            ->pluck('name', 'slug')
                        )
                        ->required(),
                ])
                ->action(function (array $data, array $record) use ($baseUrl) {
                    $response = Http::put("{$baseUrl}/products/{$record['id']}", [
                        'title' => $data['title'],
                        'category' => $data['category'],
                    ]);

                    if ($response->failed()) {
                        Notification::make()
                            ->title('Product failed to save')
                            ->danger()
                            ->send();
                            
                        return;
                    }
                    
                    Notification::make()
                        ->title('Product save')
                        ->success()
                        ->send();
                }),
        ]);
}
```

- `icon()` defines the icon shown for this action in the table.
- [`modalHeading()`](../actions/modals#customizing-the-modals-heading-description-and-submit-action-label) sets the title of the modal that appears when the action is triggered.
- [`fillForm()`](../actions/modals#filling-the-form-with-existing-data) automatically fills the form fields with the existing values of the selected record.
- [`schema()`](../actions/modals#rendering-a-schema-in-a-modal) defines the form fields displayed in the modal.
- `action()` defines the logic that will be executed when the user submits the form.

</Aside>

<Aside variant="warning">
    [`DummyJSON`](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products#products-update) API will not update it into the server. It will simulate a `PUT`/`PATCH` request and will return updated product with modified data.
</Aside>

If you don't need a modal, you can directly redirect users to a specified URL when they click the action button. You can achieve this by defining a URL with a dynamic route that includes the `record` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (array $record): string => route('products.edit', ['product' => $record['id']]))
```

#### External API view action example

The view action in this example opens a [modal](../actions/modals) displaying detailed product information fetched from an external API. This allows you to build a user interface with various components such as [text entries](../infolists/text-entry) and [images](../infolists/image-entry).

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Flex;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    $baseUrl = 'https://dummyjson.com';

    return $table
        ->records(fn (): array => Http::baseUrl($baseUrl)
            ->get('products', [
                'select' => 'id,title,description,brand,category,thumbnail,price',
            ])
            ->collect()
            ->get('products', [])
        )
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('category'),
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            Action::make('view')
                ->color('gray')
                ->icon(Heroicon::Eye)
                ->modalHeading('View product')
                ->schema([
                    Section::make()
                        ->schema([
                            Flex::make([
                                Grid::make(2)
                                    ->schema([
                                        TextEntry::make('title'),
                                        TextEntry::make('category'),
                                        TextEntry::make('brand'),
                                        TextEntry::make('price')
                                            ->money(),
                                    ]),
                                ImageEntry::make('thumbnail')
                                    ->hiddenLabel()
                                    ->grow(false),
                            ])->from('md'),
                            TextEntry::make('description')
                                ->prose(),
                        ]),
                ])
                ->modalSubmitAction(false)
                ->modalCancelActionLabel('Close'),
        ]);
}
```

- `color()` sets the color of the action button.
- `icon()` defines the icon shown for this action in the table.
- [`modalHeading()`](../actions/modals#customizing-the-modals-heading-description-and-submit-action-label) sets the title of the modal that appears when the action is triggered.
- [`schema()`](../actions/modals#rendering-a-schema-in-a-modal) defines the form fields displayed in the modal.
- [`modalSubmitAction(false)`](../actions/modals#modifying-the-default-modal-footer-action-button) disables the submit button, making this a read-only view action.
- [`modalCancelActionLabel()`](../actions/modals#modifying-the-default-modal-footer-action-button) customizes the label for the close button.

<Aside variant="warning">
    This is a basic example for demonstration purposes only. It's the developer's responsibility to implement proper authentication, authorization, validation, error handling, rate limiting, and other best practices when working with APIs.
</Aside>

<Aside variant="info">
    The [`select`](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products#products-limit_skip) parameter is used to limit the fields returned by the API. This helps reduce payload size and improves performance when rendering the table.
</Aside>

If you don't need a modal, you can directly redirect users to a specified URL when they click the action button. You can achieve this by defining a URL with a dynamic route that includes the `record` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('view')
    ->url(fn (array $record): string => route('products.view', ['product' => $record['id']]))
```

#### External API delete action example

The delete action in this example allows users to delete a product fetched from an external API.

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    $baseUrl = 'https://dummyjson.com';

    return $table
        ->records(fn (): array => Http::baseUrl($baseUrl)
            ->get('products')
            ->collect()
            ->get('products', [])
        )
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('category'),
            TextColumn::make('price')
                ->money(),
        ])
        ->recordActions([
            Action::make('delete')
                ->color('danger')
                ->icon(Heroicon::Trash)
                ->modalIcon(Heroicon::OutlinedTrash)
                ->modalHeading('Delete Product')
                ->requiresConfirmation()
                ->action(function (array $record) use ($baseUrl) {
                    $response = Http::baseUrl($baseUrl)
                        ->delete("products/{$record['id']}");

                    if ($response->failed()) {
                        Notification::make()
                            ->title('Product failed to delete')
                            ->danger()
                            ->send();
                            
                        return;
                    }
                    
                    Notification::make()
                        ->title('Product deleted')
                        ->success()
                        ->send();
                }),
        ]);
}
```

- `color()` sets the color of the action button.
- `icon()` defines the icon shown for this action in the table.
- [`modalIcon()`](../actions/modals#adding-an-icon-inside-the-modal) sets the icon that will appear in the confirmation modal.
- [`modalHeading()`](../actions/modals#customizing-the-modals-heading-description-and-submit-action-label) sets the title of the modal that appears when the action is triggered.
- [`requiresConfirmation()`](../actions/modals#confirmation-modals) ensures that the user must confirm the deletion before it is executed.
- `action()` defines the logic that will be executed when the user confirms the submission.

### External API full example

This example demonstrates how to combine [sorting](#external-api-sorting), [search](#external-api-searching), [category filtering](#external-api-filtering), and [pagination](#external-api-pagination) when using an external API as the data source. The API used here is [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com), which supports these features individually but **does not allow combining all of them in a single request**. This is because each feature uses a different endpoint:

- [Search](#external-api-searching) is performed through the `/products/search` endpoint using the `q` parameter.
- [Category filtering](#external-api-filtering) uses the `/products/category/{category}` endpoint.
- [Sorting](#external-api-sorting) is handled by sending `sortBy` and `order` parameters to the `/products` endpoint.

The only feature that can be combined with each of the above is [pagination](#external-api-pagination), since the `limit` and `skip` parameters are supported across all three endpoints.

```php

            ?string $search,
            array $filters,
            int $page,
            int $recordsPerPage
        ) use ($baseUrl): LengthAwarePaginator {
            // Get the selected category from filters (if any)
            $category = $filters['category']['value'] ?? null;

            // Choose endpoint depending on search or filter
            $endpoint = match (true) {
                filled($search) => 'products/search',
                filled($category) => "products/category/{$category}",
                default => 'products',
            };

            // Determine skip offset
            $skip = ($page - 1) * $recordsPerPage;

            // Base query parameters for all requests
            $params = [
                'limit' => $recordsPerPage,
                'skip' => $skip,
                'select' => 'id,title,brand,category,thumbnail,price,sku,stock',
            ];

            // Add search query if applicable
            if (filled($search)) {
                $params['q'] = $search;
            }

            // Add sorting parameters
            if ($endpoint === 'products' && $sortColumn) {
                $params['sortBy'] = $sortColumn;
                $params['order'] = $sortDirection ?? 'asc';
            }

            $response = Http::baseUrl($baseUrl)
                ->get($endpoint, $params)
                ->collect();

            return new LengthAwarePaginator(
                items: $response['products'],
                total: $response['total'],
                perPage: $recordsPerPage,
                currentPage: $page
            );
        })
        ->columns([

                ->state(fn (array $record): string => Str::title($record['brand'] ?? 'Unknown')),
            TextColumn::make('category')

            TextColumn::make('stock')
                ->label('Stock')
                ->sortable(),
        ])
        ->filters([
            SelectFilter::make('category')
                ->label('Category')
                ->options(fn (): Collection => Http::baseUrl($baseUrl)
                    ->get('products/categories')
                    ->collect()
                    ->pluck('name', 'slug')
                ),
        ])
        ->searchable();
}
```

title: Overview

## Introduction

Filament allows you to build dynamic dashboards, comprised of "widgets". Each widget is an element on the dashboard that displays data in a specific way. For example, you can display [stats](stats-overview), [chart](charts), or a [table](#table-widgets).

## Creating a widget

To create a widget, you can use the `make:filament-widget` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-widget MyWidget
```

This command will ask you which type of widget you want to create. You can choose from the following options:

- **Custom**: A custom widget that you can build from scratch.
- **Chart**: A widget that displays a [chart](charts).
- **Stats overview**: A widget that displays [statistics](stats-overview).
- **Table**: A widget that displays a [table](#table-widgets).

## Sorting widgets

Each widget class contains a `$sort` property that may be used to change its order on the page, relative to other widgets:

```php
protected static ?int $sort = 2;
```

## Customizing the dashboard page

If you want to customize the dashboard class, for example, to [change the number of widget columns](#customizing-the-widgets-grid), create a new file at `app/Filament/Pages/Dashboard.php`:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Pages;

use Filament\Pages\Dashboard as BaseDashboard;

class Dashboard extends BaseDashboard
{
    // ...
}
```

Finally, remove the original `Dashboard` class from [configuration file](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->discoverPages(in: app_path('Filament/Pages'), for: 'App\\Filament\\Pages')
        ->pages([]);
}
```

If you don't discover pages with `discoverPages()` in the directory you created the new dashboard class, you should manually register the class in the `pages()` method:

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Dashboard;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->pages([
            Dashboard::class,
        ]);
}
```

### Creating multiple dashboards

If you want to create multiple dashboards, you can do so by repeating [the process described above](#customizing-the-dashboard-page). Creating new pages that extend the `Dashboard` class will allow you to create as many dashboards as you need.

You will also need to define the URL path to the extra dashboard, otherwise it will be at `/`:

```php
protected static string $routePath = 'finance';
```

You may also customize the title of the dashboard by overriding the `$title` property:

```php
protected static ?string $title = 'Finance dashboard';
```

The primary dashboard shown to a user is the first one they have access to (controlled by [`canAccess()` method](../navigation/custom-pages#authorization)), according to the defined navigation sort order.

The default sort order for dashboards is `-2`. You can control the sort order of custom dashboards with `$navigationSort`:

```php
protected static ?int $navigationSort = 15;
```

### Customizing the widgets' grid

You may change how many grid columns are used to display widgets.

Firstly, you must [replace the original Dashboard page](#customizing-the-dashboard-page).

Now, in your new `app/Filament/Pages/Dashboard.php` file, you may override the `getColumns()` method to return a number of grid columns to use:

```php
public function getColumns(): int | array
{
    return 2;
}
```

#### Responsive widgets grid

You may wish to change the number of widget grid columns based on the responsive [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) of the browser. You can do this using an array that contains the number of columns that should be used at each breakpoint:

```php
public function getColumns(): int | array
{
    return [
        'md' => 4,
        'xl' => 5,
    ];
}
```

This pairs well with [responsive widget widths](#responsive-widget-widths).

#### Customizing widget width

You may customize the width of a widget using the `$columnSpan` property. You may use a number between 1 and 12 to indicate how many columns the widget should span, or `full` to make it occupy the full width of the page:

```php
protected int | string | array $columnSpan = 'full';
```

##### Responsive widget widths

You may wish to change the widget width based on the responsive [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) of the browser. You can do this using an array that contains the number of columns that the widget should occupy at each breakpoint:

```php
protected int | string | array $columnSpan = [
    'md' => 2,
    'xl' => 3,
];
```

This is especially useful when using a [responsive widgets grid](#responsive-widgets-grid).

## Conditionally hiding widgets

You may override the static `canView()` method on widgets to conditionally hide them:

```php
public static function canView(): bool
{
    return auth()->user()->isAdmin();
}
```

## Table widgets

You may easily add tables to your dashboard. Start by creating a widget with the command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-widget LatestOrders --table
```

You may now [customize the table](../tables) by editing the widget file.

## Custom widgets

To get started building a `BlogPostsOverview` widget:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-widget BlogPostsOverview
```

This command will create two files - a widget class in the `/Widgets` directory of the Filament directory, and a view in the `/widgets` directory of the Filament views directory.

The class is a [Livewire component](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/components), so any Livewire features are available to you. The Blade view can contain any HTML you like, and you can access any public Livewire properties in the view. You can also access the Livewire component instance in the view using `$this`.

## Filtering widget data

You may add a form to the dashboard that allows the user to filter the data displayed across all widgets. When the filters are updated, the widgets will be reloaded with the new data.

Firstly, you must [replace the original Dashboard page](#customizing-the-dashboard-page).

Now, in your new `app/Filament/Pages/Dashboard.php` file, you may add the `HasFiltersForm` trait, and add the `filtersForm()` method to return form components:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard as BaseDashboard;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard\Concerns\HasFiltersForm;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;

class Dashboard extends BaseDashboard
{
    use HasFiltersForm;

    public function filtersForm(Schema $schema): Schema
    {
        return $schema
            ->components([
                Section::make()
                    ->schema([
                        DatePicker::make('startDate'),
                        DatePicker::make('endDate'),
                        // ...
                    ])
                    ->columns(3),
            ]);
    }
}
```

In widget classes that require data from the filters, you need to add the `InteractsWithPageFilters` trait, which will allow you to use the `$this->pageFilters` property to access the raw data from the filters form:

```php
use App\Models\BlogPost;
use Carbon\CarbonImmutable;
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget;
use Filament\Widgets\Concerns\InteractsWithPageFilters;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

class BlogPostsOverview extends StatsOverviewWidget
{
    use InteractsWithPageFilters;

    public function getStats(): array
    {
        $startDate = $this->pageFilters['startDate'] ?? null;
        $endDate = $this->pageFilters['endDate'] ?? null;

        return [
            StatsOverviewWidget\Stat::make(
                label: 'Total posts',
                value: BlogPost::query()
                    ->when($startDate, fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereDate('created_at', '>=', $startDate))
                    ->when($endDate, fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereDate('created_at', '<=', $endDate))
                    ->count(),
            ),
            // ...
        ];
    }
}
```

The `$this->pageFilters` array will always reflect the current form data. Please note that this data is not validated, as it is available live and not intended to be used for anything other than querying the database. You must ensure that the data is valid before using it. In this example, we check if the start date is set before using it in the query.

### Filtering widget data using an action modal

Alternatively, you can swap out the filters form for an action modal, that can be opened by clicking a button in the header of the page. There are many benefits to using this approach:

- The filters form is not always visible, which allows you to use the full height of the page for widgets.
- The filters do not update the widgets until the user clicks the "Apply" button, which means that the widgets are not reloaded until the user is ready. This can improve performance if the widgets are expensive to load.
- Validation can be performed on the filters form, which means that the widgets can rely on the fact that the data is valid - the user cannot submit the form until it is. Canceling the modal will discard the user's changes.

To use an action modal instead of a filters form, you can use the `HasFiltersAction` trait instead of `HasFiltersForm`. Then, register the `FilterAction` class as an action in `getHeaderActions()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard as BaseDashboard;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard\Actions\FilterAction;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard\Concerns\HasFiltersAction;

class Dashboard extends BaseDashboard
{
    use HasFiltersAction;
    
    protected function getHeaderActions(): array
    {
        return [
            FilterAction::make()
                ->schema([
                    DatePicker::make('startDate'),
                    DatePicker::make('endDate'),
                    // ...
                ]),
        ];
    }
}
```

Handling data from the filter action is the same as handling data from the filters header form, except that the data is validated before being passed to the widget. The `InteractsWithPageFilters` trait still applies.

### Persisting widget filters in the user's session

By default, the dashboard filters applied will persist in the user's session between page loads. To disable this, override the `$persistsFiltersInSession` property in the dashboard page class:

```php
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard as BaseDashboard;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard\Concerns\HasFiltersForm;

class Dashboard extends BaseDashboard
{
    use HasFiltersForm;

    protected bool $persistsFiltersInSession = false;
}
```

Alternatively, override the `persistsFiltersInSession()` method in the dashboard page class:

```php
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard as BaseDashboard;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard\Concerns\HasFiltersForm;

class Dashboard extends BaseDashboard
{
    use HasFiltersForm;

    public function persistsFiltersInSession(): bool
    {
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Disabling the default widgets

By default, two widgets are displayed on the dashboard. These widgets can be disabled by updating the `widgets()` array of the [configuration](../panel-configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->widgets([]);
}
```

title: Stats overview widgets
---

## Introduction

Filament comes with a "stats overview" widget template, which you can use to display a number of different stats in a single widget, without needing to write a custom view.

Start by creating a widget with the command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-widget StatsOverview --stats-overview
```

This command will create a new `StatsOverview.php` file. Open it, and return `Stat` instances from the `getStats()` method:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Widgets;

use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget as BaseWidget;
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

class StatsOverview extends BaseWidget
{
    protected function getStats(): array
    {
        return [
            Stat::make('Unique views', '192.1k'),
            Stat::make('Bounce rate', '21%'),
            Stat::make('Average time on page', '3:12'),
        ];
    }
}
```

Now, check out your widget in the dashboard.

## Adding a description and icon to a stat

You may add a `description()` to provide additional information, along with a `descriptionIcon()`:

```php
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

protected function getStats(): array
{
    return [
        Stat::make('Unique views', '192.1k')
            ->description('32k increase')
            ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-up'),
        Stat::make('Bounce rate', '21%')
            ->description('7% decrease')
            ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-down'),
        Stat::make('Average time on page', '3:12')
            ->description('3% increase')
            ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-up'),
    ];
}
```

The `descriptionIcon()` method also accepts a second parameter to put the icon before the description instead of after it:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\IconPosition;
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

Stat::make('Unique views', '192.1k')
    ->description('32k increase')
    ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-up', IconPosition::Before)
```

## Changing the color of the stat

You may also give stats a [color](../styling/colors):

```php
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

protected function getStats(): array
{
    return [
        Stat::make('Unique views', '192.1k')
            ->description('32k increase')
            ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-up')
            ->color('success'),
        Stat::make('Bounce rate', '21%')
            ->description('7% increase')
            ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-down')
            ->color('danger'),
        Stat::make('Average time on page', '3:12')
            ->description('3% increase')
            ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-up')
            ->color('success'),
    ];
}
```

## Adding extra HTML attributes to a stat

You may also pass extra HTML attributes to stats using `extraAttributes()`:

```php
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

protected function getStats(): array
{
    return [
        Stat::make('Processed', '192.1k')
            ->color('success')
            ->extraAttributes([
                'class' => 'cursor-pointer',
                'wire:click' => "\$dispatch('setStatusFilter', { filter: 'processed' })",
            ]),
        // ...
    ];
}
```

In this example, we are deliberately escaping the `$` in `$dispatch()` since this needs to be passed directly to the HTML, it is not a PHP variable.

## Adding a chart to a stat

You may also add or chain a `chart()` to each stat to provide historical data. The `chart()` method accepts an array of data points to plot:

```php
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

protected function getStats(): array
{
    return [
        Stat::make('Unique views', '192.1k')
            ->description('32k increase')
            ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-up')
            ->chart([7, 2, 10, 3, 15, 4, 17])
            ->color('success'),
        // ...
    ];
}
```

## Live updating stats (polling)

By default, stats overview widgets refresh their data every 5 seconds.

To customize this, you may override the `$pollingInterval` property on the class to a new interval:

```php
protected ?string $pollingInterval = '10s';
```

Alternatively, you may disable polling altogether:

```php
protected ?string $pollingInterval = null;
```

## Disabling lazy loading

By default, widgets are lazy-loaded. This means that they will only be loaded when they are visible on the page.

To disable this behavior, you may override the `$isLazy` property on the widget class:

```php
protected static bool $isLazy = false;
```

## Adding a heading and description

You may also add heading and description text above the widget by overriding the `$heading` and `$description` properties:

```php
protected ?string $heading = 'Analytics';

protected ?string $description = 'An overview of some analytics.';
```

If you need to dynamically generate the heading or description text, you can instead override the `getHeading()` and `getDescription()` methods:

```php
protected function getHeading(): ?string
{
    return 'Analytics';
}

protected function getDescription(): ?string
{
    return 'An overview of some analytics.';
}
```

## Introduction

Filament comes with many "chart" widget templates, which you can use to display real-time, interactive charts.

Start by creating a widget with the command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-widget BlogPostsChart --chart
```

There is a single `ChartWidget` class that is used for all charts. The type of chart is set by the `getType()` method. In this example, that method returns the string `'line'`.

The `protected ?string $heading` variable is used to set the heading that describes the chart. If you need to set the heading dynamically, you can override the `getHeading()` method.

The `getData()` method is used to return an array of datasets and labels. Each dataset is a labeled array of points to plot on the chart, and each label is a string. This structure is identical to the [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs) library, which Filament uses to render charts. You may use the [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs) to fully understand the possibilities to return from `getData()`, based on the chart type.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Widgets;

use Filament\Widgets\ChartWidget;

class BlogPostsChart extends ChartWidget
{
    protected ?string $heading = 'Blog Posts';

    protected function getData(): array
    {
        return [
            'datasets' => [
                [
                    'label' => 'Blog posts created',
                    'data' => [0, 10, 5, 2, 21, 32, 45, 74, 65, 45, 77, 89],
                ],
            ],
            'labels' => ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'],
        ];
    }

    protected function getType(): string
    {
        return 'line';
    }
}
```

Now, check out your widget in the dashboard.

## Available chart types

Below is a list of available chart widget classes which you may extend, and their corresponding [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs) documentation page, for inspiration on what to return from `getData()`:

- Bar chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/bar)
- Bubble chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/bubble)
- Doughnut chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/doughnut)
- Line chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line)
- Pie chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/doughnut.html#pie)
- Polar area chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/polar)
- Radar chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/radar)
- Scatter chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/scatter)

## Customizing the chart color

You can customize the [color](../styling/colors) of the chart data by setting the `$color` property:

```php
protected string $color = 'info';
```

If you're looking to customize the color further, or use multiple colors across multiple datasets, you can still make use of Chart.js's [color options](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/general/colors.html) in the data:

```php
protected function getData(): array
{
    return [
        'datasets' => [
            [
                'label' => 'Blog posts created',
                'data' => [0, 10, 5, 2, 21, 32, 45, 74, 65, 45, 77, 89],
                'backgroundColor' => '#36A2EB',
                'borderColor' => '#9BD0F5',
            ],
        ],
        'labels' => ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'],
    ];
}
```

## Generating chart data from an Eloquent model

To generate chart data from an Eloquent model, Filament recommends that you install the `flowframe/laravel-trend` package. You can view the [documentation](https://github.com/Flowframe/laravel-trend).

Here is an example of generating chart data from a model using the `laravel-trend` package:

```php
use Flowframe\Trend\Trend;
use Flowframe\Trend\TrendValue;

protected function getData(): array
{
    $data = Trend::model(BlogPost::class)
        ->between(
            start: now()->startOfYear(),
            end: now()->endOfYear(),
        )
        ->perMonth()
        ->count();

    return [
        'datasets' => [
            [
                'label' => 'Blog posts',
                'data' => $data->map(fn (TrendValue $value) => $value->aggregate),
            ],
        ],
        'labels' => $data->map(fn (TrendValue $value) => $value->date),
    ];
}
```

## Filtering chart data

### Basic Select filter

You can set up chart filters to change the data that is presented. Commonly, this is used to change the time period that chart data is rendered for.

To set a default filter value, set the `$filter` property:

```php
public ?string $filter = 'today';
```

Then, define the `getFilters()` method to return an array of values and labels for your filter:

```php
protected function getFilters(): ?array
{
    return [
        'today' => 'Today',
        'week' => 'Last week',
        'month' => 'Last month',
        'year' => 'This year',
    ];
}
```

You can use the active filter value within your `getData()` method:

```php
protected function getData(): array
{
    $activeFilter = $this->filter;

    // ...
}
```

### Custom filters

You can use [schema components](../schemas) to build custom filters for your chart widget. This approach offers a more flexible way to define filters.

To get started, use the `HasFiltersSchema` trait and implement the `filtersSchema()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Schemas\Schema;
use Filament\Widgets\ChartWidget\Concerns\HasFiltersSchema;

class BlogPostsChart extends ChartWidget
{
    use HasFiltersSchema;
    
    // ...
    
    public function filtersSchema(Schema $schema): Schema
    {
        return $schema->components([
            DatePicker::make('startDate')
                ->default(now()->subDays(30)),
            DatePicker::make('endDate')
                ->default(now()),
        ]);
    }
}
```

The filter values are accessible via the `$this->filters` array. You can use these values inside your `getData()` method:

```php
protected function getData(): array
{
    $startDate = $this->filters['startDate'] ?? null;
    $endDate = $this->filters['endDate'] ?? null;

    return [
        // ...
    ];
}
```

The `$this->filters` array will always reflect the current form data. Please note that this data is not validated, as it is available live and not intended to be used for anything other than querying the database. You must ensure that the data is valid before using it.

    If you want to add filters that apply to multiple widgets at once, see [filtering widget data](overview#filtering-widget-data) in the dashboard.
</Aside>

## Live updating chart data (polling)

By default, chart widgets refresh their data every 5 seconds.

To customize this, you may override the `$pollingInterval` property on the class to a new interval:

```php
protected ?string $pollingInterval = '10s';
```

Alternatively, you may disable polling altogether:

```php
protected ?string $pollingInterval = null;
```

## Setting a maximum chart height

You may place a maximum height on the chart to ensure that it doesn't get too big, using the `$maxHeight` property:

```php
protected ?string $maxHeight = '300px';
```

## Setting chart configuration options

You may specify an `$options` variable on the chart class to control the many configuration options that the Chart.js library provides. For instance, you could turn off the [legend](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/configuration/legend.html) for a line chart:

```php
protected ?array $options = [
    'plugins' => [
        'legend' => [
            'display' => false,
        ],
    ],
];
```

Alternatively, you can override the `getOptions()` method to return a dynamic array of options:

```php
protected function getOptions(): array
{
    return [
        'plugins' => [
            'legend' => [
                'display' => false,
            ],
        ],
    ];
}
```

These PHP arrays will get transformed into JSON objects when the chart is rendered. If you want to return raw JavaScript from this method instead, you can return a `RawJs` object. This is useful if you want to use a JavaScript callback function, for example:

```php
use Filament\Support\RawJs;

protected function getOptions(): RawJs
{
    return RawJs::make(<<<JS
        {
            scales: {
                y: {
                    ticks: {
                        callback: (value) => '€' + value,
                    },
                },
            },
        }
    JS);
}
```

## Adding a description

You may add a description, below the heading of the chart, using the `getDescription()` method:

```php
public function getDescription(): ?string
{
    return 'The number of blog posts published per month.';
}
```

## Disabling lazy loading

By default, widgets are lazy-loaded. This means that they will only be loaded when they are visible on the page.

To disable this behavior, you may override the `$isLazy` property on the widget class:

```php
protected static bool $isLazy = true;
```

## Making the chart collapsible

You may allow the chart to be collapsible by setting the `$isCollapsible` property on the widget class to be `true`:

```php
protected bool $isCollapsible = true;
```

## Using custom Chart.js plugins

Chart.js offers a powerful plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality and create custom chart behaviors. This guide details how to use them in a chart widget.

### Step 1: Install the plugin with NPM

To start with, install the plugin using NPM into your project. In this guide, we will install [`chartjs-plugin-datalabels`](https://chartjs-plugin-datalabels.netlify.app/guide/getting-started.html#installation):

```bash
npm install chartjs-plugin-datalabels --save-dev
```

### Step 2: Create a JavaScript file importing the plugin

Create a new JavaScript file where you will define your custom plugin. In this guide, we'll call it `filament-chart-js-plugins.js`. Import the plugin, and add it to the `window.filamentChartJsPlugins` array:

```javascript
import ChartDataLabels from 'chartjs-plugin-datalabels'

window.filamentChartJsPlugins ??= []
window.filamentChartJsPlugins.push(ChartDataLabels)
```

It's important to initialise the array if it has not been already, before pushing onto it. This ensures that mutliple JavaScript files (especially those from Filament plugins) that register Chart.js plugins do not overwrite each other, regardless of the order they are booted in.

You can push as many plugins to the `filamentChartJsPlugins` array as you would like to install, you do not need a separate file to import each plugin.

### Step 3: Compile the JavaScript file with Vite

Now, you need to build the JavaScript file with Vite, or your bundler of choice. Include the file in your Vite configuration (usually `vite.config.js`). For example:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: [
                'resources/css/app.css',
                'resources/js/app.js',
                'resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css',
                'resources/js/filament-chart-js-plugins.js', // Include the new file in the `input` array so it is built
            ],
        }),
    ],
});
```

Build the file with `npm run build`.

### Step 4: Register the JavaScript file in Filament

Filament needs to know to include this JavaScript file when rendering chart widgets. You can do this in the `boot()` method of a service provider like `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\Js;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Vite;

FilamentAsset::register([
    Js::make('chart-js-plugins', Vite::asset('resources/js/filament-chart-js-plugins.js'))->module(),
]);
```
